<h2 id="orgc996301">Sant Agata Church</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc996301">
<p>
Sitting in front of me is Sant'Agata church, or what remains of it.
Despite It's age, being born in the 16th century, the church stands
strong from the ground, challenging time itself.  We rest together
on a "Doss" which is a tall hill or bump from the ground, but too
modest to be considered a mountain, laying between Povo and
Oltrecastello. Everything is quiet here except the birds and the
noise of the cars from the city beneath.
</p>

<p>
Reaching the top of the Doss is simple. From Povo, more specifically
Piazza Manci, one can follow the street going east towards Cimirlo.
At the first opportunity, turn left when you see a SAT sign advertising
a walk reaching Oltrecastello. The trail quickly goes up for the first
10 minutes, and slows down for the remaining 15. Despite the first
half, the path is generous with many benches to let the explorer
catch some breath. Overall, the walk is easily accessible even for
elderly people, I even met two elderly women while I was going up.
An alternative route would be from Oltrecastello, following the
street towards Povo and turning right just after the main piazza
of the town. The path here is shorter but steeper. Obviously, you
could go down from either of the two ways.

<p>
From up here one can enjoy a good view of Adige's valley, with Its
urban areas and urban noises, especially the southern parts of Trento.
Instead, the small fraction of Borino and Cimirlo are perfectly
visible in their entirety, a rare sight since they are often hidden by
this same doss. Surrounding the hill stand the mount of Marzola on the
South-East, mount Celva from east, mount Calisio on the northern side
and the valley on the west. The snow on top of Paganella and Bondone
can be appreciated even during the spring, although this year the snow
has been very shy.

</div>

<p>
Up here there is a flat grass area where you can enjoy the view and
some fresh air, with plenty of benches and space to rest. Most of
the area is now inaccessible because of some excavations beneath the
ground. A long long time ago there was a fortress here meant to
protect the city from attacks coming from Valsugana. When the
fortress was not necessary anymore, It got dismantled but the
foundations still remains.

</div>

<p>
Dominating the area stands a modest church made of stone and
concrete. The look of the church is very simple, with only some
framing around the two windows on the side of the wooden door at the
front of the house facing west. The walls lack any kind of decoration,
displaying all ruthless of time like an old person. A hollow structure
on the roof hints of a bell lost to time. Despite It's size, the
church catches the attention and the imagination of the people coming
up here, wondering of the devoted and hard working people who created
it in a past era.

</div>

<p>
Peeking at the windows, the interior looks as abandoned as the
exterior. A wooden floor with some benches fills the empty space,
hidden by a layer of dust and the lack of sun light. On the back
sleeps what used to be an altar, retired from Its important job,
now discredited and disrespected.

<p>
A good variety of flowers and plants surround the church, keeping
spring alive. The green grass is painted with colors of violet, yellow
and white.
