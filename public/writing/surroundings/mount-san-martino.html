<p>
Mount San Martino (~1400m) is located west of Bleggio Superiore and
east from Val Rendena, in a beautiful place called Giudicarie.  The
whole area of Bleggio is a place rich with history and legends. Once
upon a time, in the medieval age, merchants and popes would travel
through those lands to go north, villages developed, churches were
built. Even to this day, this place still holds the memory of a great
and prosperous time. In modern times, due to industrialization, the
valley of Adige began developing and became the main road to the
north and an important industrial center. Still, this place gained
something else, it is now a peaceful, wonderful place, respectful of
nature and life itself.
</p>

<p>
We begin our hike on the location of Larido, south of Rango (as a
sidenote, Rango is famous for Christmas shops) where there are places
to park. The path forward is not certain at the start, since there are
no signs mentioning the mountain top, so with a bit of trust we follow
the only path west going upward.
</p>

<p>
The hike is a safe one, the overall height difference is 670m but the
rate of change in elevation is smooth across the whole hike, without
any difficult sections. We choose this hike because there is still
snow over 1500m so we planned to stay low (spoiler, we still found
some snow in unilluminated areas). After some time, the view opens to
the valley below, looking east. The tops of Bondone and Stivo are very
recognizable, dominating over the other mountains.

<p>
Midway to the top, a grass area opens up. A few tiny, little one-room
houses are scattered here and there, one high up, one far down the
edge. The view here is wonderful, the sun shines, no car noises
can be heard. We spot a young couple enjoying their breakfast in the
garden, we say hello to them and shared a smile, as everyone does with
strangers.

<p>
All of a sudden we reach the top, where a radio tower replaces
the usual cross we find in mountain tops. We stop for a break and
to have launch and some laughs.

<p>
Descending here is easy, we take the well made forestale path, and
then we switch to an abandoned one which is barely visible. It had a
magical feel, as if we were in a forgotten forest with witches and
monsters, with dead trees left and right to disorient us.  We came out
alive towards the strada provinciale before taking another path back
to Larido, were everything started.  Before that, we took some time
to play with an horse.
