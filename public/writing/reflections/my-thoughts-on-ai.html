<h2 id="orga9b1ea9">My thoughts on AI</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga9b1ea9">
<p>
As the year 2025 came to an end, I wanted to write down my current
thoughts on AI and the world in general. For some years now I have
been observing the industry and reflecting on the benefits and risks
of the technology before maturing an opinion of my own. I still don't
have a clear mind about it, and things change continuously; I may
realize that all my reflections were wrong. But I think it is worth
making an effort to summarize my hopes and fears, and my reading of
what is happening in the world, as a checkpoint of sorts. Don't expect
any bold claims or visionary CEO-like statements as I am not that type
of person.
</p>

<p>
The tech-nerds did it again, they revolutionized the way we work
through technology, one that affects all areas of life far beyond the
tech world, making the AI-thing a topic of discussion for the general
population. AI is not only a theoretical thought or a piece of science
fiction, but it has been already integrated in many areas of our
work-life and personal life, with the young generation being affected
the most.
</p>

<p>
It still captures me how humanity is able to keep inventing and
innovating, is this something profoundly coded in human nature?
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org65f9ce3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org65f9ce3">Market (and geopolitics)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org65f9ce3">
<p>
The market in the last few years showed that competition is strong as
companies invest and adapt quickly to the new status-quo, with a
remarkable speed and force I have to say. This is part of the Silicon
Valley culture which made them so succesfull and central in the USA
and global economy. The tech market clearly went all-in on Altman's
vision, showing elasticity and an attitude to restructure and take
risks. Many governments like USA and the EU now recognize the
technology as a matter of national-interest and are highly
invested. New players like Anthropic and several Chinese companies
have placed themselves strongly in the market especially with open
source models, showing signs of an healthy economy, while the usual
big companies keep their central position and influence (as expected).
</p>

<p>
China is advancing rapidly and has shown to be able to compete with
American companies on software and services, I expect this to continue
at a fast pace. All eyes are on USA and China right now, Trump is
right to worry about it. The manufacturing power of China, their rich
resources, high capacity to produce electricity, and the control of
the communist party over the population and its narrative is making
China incredibly competitive, while Europe continues to lack behind in
every respect. Still, USA leads the way in developing and delivering
the new technology to costumers. More broadly, USA showed that it is
willing to go to great extents to protect their interests.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if at the end of the Trump administration USA will be in
a better or worse position. His focus on protectionism and
national-interests may be a great opportunity or a failure and cause
of global uncertainty. While there was a slight fall in the SP500 due
to rapidly changing tariffs, the index quickly recovered and is going
as strong as always. TSMC is building major semiconductor factories in
USA. Tech is going strong but it is highly exposed to AI investments;
there is a rising concern that the market is growing a bubble that may
explode sooner or later, which would damage the American economy, but
this is just speculation.

</div>

<p>
Europe is outside of the international picture, mocked by all
players. The EU continues its decline and shrink, its failure to
innovate and be competitive together with years of damaging policies
like the Green deal, the shutting down of atomic power plants and car
industry crisis in Germany, together with sanctions on Russia and an
aging population made the union's economy unproductive. Europe's
non-investments in military and the reliance on American technology
and military protection has made it weak. In a world where
international law is but a piece of paper, Europe is un-armed and
surrounded by dangerous wolves.
</p>

<p>
I think there are two different analysis on artificial
intelligence. One is purely technological, the other one is the social
impact it has. As a programmer and a technical person, I am more akin
to spend brain time in the technical part, as I feel more comfortable
about it. Still, it is important to reflect about how society will
evolve too.

<h3 id="org89bed85">As a technology</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org89bed85">
<p>
AI was made possible by the intersection of ground-breaking research,
the availability of compute and the willingness to throw huge amounts
of capital in the technology. The Silicon Valley has always excelled
in these things. It would not be possible to run all these LLMs at
scale without big datacenters run by massive cloud providers globally,
the advancements in semiconductors manufacturing and in datacenter
hardware. Power production limits scalability, but this can be solved
by throwing more money at it and by having good government policies
that are favorable to companies.
</p>

<p>
AI is a new way of learning. It is now easier than ever to get
answers to complex questions. Instead of desperately searching online
in some old forums, or trying to find extracts from books that may
answer our question, the AI will quickly provide a well-explained
answer with the opportunity to ask more questions and go deeper (with
references sometimes). RAG helps to consult large collections of
documents, such as software documentation. Obviously we shouldn't be
naive and take everything the AI generated as truth, much like when we
read something on the internet. As long as we keep this in mind and
remain critical thinkers, AI is an useful tool to our curiosity and
imagination.
</p>

<p>
AI is a new way of working, especially for software developers. The
development of AI agents is a new layer over the already complex
landscape of software. If you are working in web backend /
infrastructure, you have to understand and keep up with the
technology. For all the other developers and creators, AI is an
helpful tool that enhances our abilities to create. It helps companies
and individuals be more productive, cutting costs and time if used
wisely and effectively.
</p>

<p>
Multimodal AIs keep getting better and better. Talking is smooth, and
image generation is decent - which is now used in commercials,
advertisement and magazines. I noticed how much this technology has
been adopted when the primary users of these types of generation are
regular people, not only corporations.
</p>

<p>
I was walking in my home town and I noticed here and there some
AI-generated manifests about local events or meet-ups - things like
chess courses or small concerts. In my family, everybody is using AI
even if they are not tech people. Similarly in my university, AI fully
reached global adoption. Indeed, everybody with a commercial device
and an internet connection can use these services, which explains
their huge growth. Never have I haver seen a technology integrated so
fast, maybe the only example I can think of is Zoom during covid.
</p>

<p>
With open source models it is now possible to fully develop models and
agents locally, and the rise of small models and AI-optimized hardware
makes it possible to run them locally on commodity hardware. In
general, consumer electronics in 2025 is powerful enough to run decent
models, a triumph of technology. For me, this is just another system
to thinker with like any other, not much has changed.

<h3 id="org23904d3">Impact on Society</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org23904d3">
<p>
While I am enthusiastic on the technological side, when it comes to its
impact on society I am deeply concerned and pessimist at best.
</p>

<p>
We are now seeing many people, especially programmers, worried about
getting replaced by AI. I think the reality is that managers will keep
firing everybody they can and there will be fewer opportunities for
junior positions. I think that a shift in mind-set of many (even
greatly talented) programmers is inevitable: embrace the new way of
software development. I don't see much of a difference from the
direction the industry have been going for a long time: programming in
big corporations was already stripped from any creativity and joy; the
state of web development shows that good software is nothing but an
old dream of the past, that knowing some javascript framework has more
value than deep technical knowledge. I see a similar situation on the
cloud community and in how the industry talks about AI.
</p>

<p>
I deeply love writing code and figuring out things on my own - and I
will keep doing this in my own projects - but we need to accept that
coding as a job is mostly automated by AI and companies only care
about dev speed and cutting costs to increase margins. If ever an AI
will be so good to code something as complex as the Linux kernel on
its own, then these companies would fire every single programmer
left. This causes a lot of frustration and pain to the people
passionate about code and the old way of software development, who
made their passion part of their identity. I put myself in this
list. I think this is similar for other artists and creators, the
reality is that these activities are largely automated in large
businesses so you may struggle to find a job. Still, the human drive
to keep creating will never die, and people will keep painting and
composing music, just like people still play chess even if the game is
completely solved by AI. Yet I cannot think of this as a positive
change, even if it is completely rational from the company's POV.
</p>

<p>
A greater issue is that people are relying on AI more and more - even
for basic tasks. I see this in my younger brothers, AI is over-used
everywhere. The human mind is lazy, it is easier to get dopamine from
entertainment than to learn hard things. This is why short-form
content is so popular, and I think this is very negative overall
("brain rot"). Having an AI technology we depend on is extremely
dangerous in these circumstances if adopted from a young age.
</p>

<p>
Will we really be able to deeply and intimately understand and reason
about things by using AI? For an experienced person the answer is
probably yes, and he will take great advantage of AI to write things
that it would have taken a long time to do manually. But for the
student, for the junior, I think raw tinkering and experience in
actually DOING the thing is incredibly valuable. This is what I have
always thought and this is how I learn things. My challenge is the
following: when ever do we stop learning? If the best way of learning
is doing things by yourself, then at what point do we stop doing
things by ourself and instead let an AI do the job for us? I want to
keep learning.
</p>

<p>
The fall of critical thinking is a bigger problem that has been rising
way before AI was a thing. We don't practice critical thinking and
rationally evaluating our ideas, instead we are increasingly
distracted by entertainment and polarized by social media. Public
schools don't teach how to think, instead in Italy schools are based
on memorization and frequent notional tests. AI is just makes things
worse.
</p>

<p>
No wonder why therapy by psychologists is so popular - even for
regular people without mental illnesses.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the content generated by AI is of really low
quality. Still, we are flooded by articles, blogs and news completely
and effortlessly written by an AI. As I said, the human mind is lazy
and if it can find a way to not put effort in something, it will do
it. This makes for the phenomena of "slop" content we see everywhere.
Most of the internet and social media is unreadable and unwatchable
and I think it is deeply unhealthy to spend time online. This is
really sad but it is the reality and we have to live with it, but my
concern goes to the younger generations who may find it difficult not
to use AI systems.
</p>

<p>
I see the overall quality of everything going lower and lower, and
good things are rare and difficult to find, outliers. I don't think
this is a good direction.
</p>

<p>
But my concerns are about how AI will be used. If you are smart and
educated, AIs are really great tools. For this reason I think that
overall this is a great technology which is worth developing and
improving. It all comes down to the user, much like the internet, or
any other technology.
</p>

<p>
The greater issue for our democracies is extreme political
polarization. I see this often in my university, where people are
violently and extremely concerned about some problems (most of them
aligned to left / extreme-left ideas) but completely blind and
adversary to other opinions and world views. This is dangerous as it
can only get worse as social media promote the most extreme opinions
for more clicks.

<h3 id="orgefa8d16">What is a programmer - What it means to be human</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgefa8d16">
<p>
I have always valued deep technical knowledge, critical thinking and
having a balanced perspective. What I see outside is the complete
opposite, the AI may be able to do many things, but it feels empty and
shallow. I think to be human is to feel things, make things that make
us proud, or any other emotion really. The programmer - as a job -
will be more towards understanding software rather than writing
it. Understanding will still be valued and your abilities augmented by
the technology.
