<p>
What you are witnessing here is my last iteration of my attempts to
<a href="documenting.html">document my life</a>. I have been doing this for some years, with
different methods and ideas.
</p>

<p>
It all started during my last year of <b><b>high school</b></b> when I was in a
period of great changes and open questions, I needed a way to clear my
mind and express myself and my thoughts. So I took a notebook I had
laying around and I started writing every now and then. As time
passed, I kept doing it out of necessity and personal development: I
would often look back at my previous writings to study them and see in
which direction I was heading to. Furthermore, <b><b>I enjoyed the idea of
having a collection of data about all my life</b></b> that felt personal. For
many people this may be photos, but for me it is writing.
</p>

<p>
The more I wrote, the more complex and sophisticated my diaries
became. At my fourth paper diary, I had developed a habit where each
weekend I would revise my writings, divide them into paragraphs based on
the subjects and the emotions, and summarize them in another "year
diary". That was a lot of effort, I wanted to expand it and have
something where I could link music, pictures, videos and query the
contents quickly, and that required less maintenance.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Here I started to investigate how to move my current analogical system
to a digital one with <b><b>Notion</b></b>, I started some projects but were quickly
abandoned because of my next discovery.
</p>

<p>
On my second year of <b><b>university</b></b> I started building my second brain
with <b><b>Obsidian</b></b>. The idea was really cool: previously I was keeping a
diary of my thoughts, but with the second brain project I was saving
everything including links, youtube videos, research papers, etc&#x2026;  I
enjoyed the idea of having everything locally and in markdown.  I felt
organized but looking back at it now I realize I wasn't. The amount of
notes quickly became too big and my attempts to reorganize it never
satisfied me. I researched very intricate and sophisticated
over-engineered methods to partition the subjects but it didn't feel
good anymore.
</p>

<p>
This was the time where I was trying out <b><b>emacs</b></b>, I remember I was
spending days and nights compiling linux from scratch and I was using
emacs as my window manager. I had such a minimal kernel configuration,
I really felt ashamed that I was using an electron-based GUI program
to take notes. It was natural that I would discover org mode and emacs
lisp. So, I began rebuilding this blog from the foundations of the
Obsidian's second brain, it will take some time to fill this with
content but I feel like it will be worth It. I like how I can manage
everything from emacs, I have written my elisp code to help me
generate the html website, pdf books and rss notifications. I like
that this is me trying to open and share something online, as a
portfolio of some sort.
</p>

<p>
I still keep a private physical diary, I guess I went back to
simpler times. The emacs diary is in continuous evolution and
expansion, with some decent quality and organization without being
too complicated, I feel like I have found a good balance, let's
see where this will go next.
