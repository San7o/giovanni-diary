<p>
I was born in the city of Senigallia in the east coast of Italy. Later
my family was joined by two younger brothers and one sister.

I don't have many memories of my early childhood. When I was about 10
(I think) I began playing minecraft 1.5.2 and watching youtube videos
about the game, the oldest videos I recall are the ones of
"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ELeternaL/videos">EternalLove</a>". My first world was in creative mode, I was in an island
and I was slowly learning what blocks were available and how they
worked in the game. I later started a <a href="https://youtu.be/bq1IvqHm1hM?si=0_RwR9lEFWRqlvIi">survival world</a> which I would
continue for many years, my base was in a swamp biome.
