The first year of university I was feeling a lot of pressure and
anxiety, yet I managed to be stoic about It and kept pushing
through. At the end of January 2023 I travelled across Europe alone
with <a href="../stash/photography/interrail.html">interrail</a>, this was meant as a voyage of self discovery and I
wrote hundreds of pages of my diary. It was a period where I felt
stuck and I was uncertain about my future. In the second half of the
year I began <a href="../stash/volunteering.html">volunteering</a> in a local hiking association. I was
organizing hikes for groups of kids, I felt a lot of responsibility
but I also had a lot of fun. I learned a lot. In the summer I went one
week in the mountains and I joined a folk dances group.

In my second year at university was a difficult year, by the end of it
I went through a big breakdown that would follow me for another
year. I decided to focus fully on studying computer science, which is
what I have always liked. I began intermediate projects like a <a href="https://github.com/San7o/Brenta-Engine">game
engine</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/San7o/Baldo-Scanner">vulnerability scanner</a> and I got into Linux kernel
development and cloud computing.
