After a family trip in northern Italy I remember I was curious about
"how do people make computer programs", so I asked my dad, which is
not an expert, but he hinted that they were made with programming
languages "like C++". When I came back home I started looking what was
this "c++".  I downloaded dev-c++ and began writing classic programs
like text based games with decision trees. I <a href="old-programs-cpp.html">still have many of those</a>.
</p>

<p>
When I was about 13 I began watching youtube videos on <a href="https://youtu.be/6AZmhj82W-8?si=AkQrqeGK4nUhTl6F">how to make
videogames with Unity</a> engine and I made my own little horror
games. I remember spending most of my wake time watching these videos,
programming in C# and playing either minecraft of The Sims 1.
</p>

<p>
During that time I wanted to <a href="../stash/youtube.html">make youtube videos myself</a> so I started a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@San7oS">gaming channel</a> where I would play minecraft and other games. This was
a long yourney: I learned things like redstone, video editing and
recording, photoshop and much more. I was really invested in my
minecraft world and I remember this period as an happy one.

<p>
I also started playing the <a href="../stash/piano.html">piano</a>! Now it was time for me to go to <a href="high-school.html">high
school</a>.
