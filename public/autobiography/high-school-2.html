Yet, I was a very shy and introverted person, and quite socially
awkward and isolated. On my last year of high school I began pushing
myself out of my comfort zone and partecipated in some activities like
<a href="../ephemeris/2025-05-14.html">theater</a>, creative writing and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHoOj4z4-qs">public speaking</a>. This was the bravest
decision of my life and it would change its course. Slowly, I
started getting used to going outside of my room and being surrounded
by other people, something I was greatly struggling (and still do
sometimes). I also met F which helped me a lot with my self confidence
and isolation.

I also travelled by myself for the fist time: I went to <a href="../stash/photography/sicily.html">Sicily</a> several
times, I still remember those days vividly, then to Florence for a
performance and to Turin for the national final of the cybersecurity
olimpiads. I graduated with top marks and I started writing my diary.

<p>
I <a href="university.html">continued my studies</a> in Computer Science in Trento, in the beautiful
Italian Alps.
