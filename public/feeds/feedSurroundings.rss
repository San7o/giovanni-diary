Here I am up Doss Trento, the closest elevation from the city center.
You may recognize this doss by the proud white monument of Cesare
Battisti looking over the valley. The doss feels smaller than expected
from up here, there are two main grass areas: one next to the monument
and another one next to a war museum. I visited the museum a while
ago, displayed were uniforms, weapons and tools used by the people of
this lands during world war 1. The purpose of this entire doss seems
to be to hold the memory of such a terrible past. Some scary weapons
lay on the outside, with some people standing over them as if It were a
bench. Other people come here to walk ther dogs or just to take a
breath.

<title>San Marco Garden</title>

I find myself in the San Marco Garden. The garden is situated in the
center of the city of Trento, in the oldest part. The park is an odd
but beautiful place, a drop of green in the middle of buildings and
busyness. Surraunded by medieval walls, It feels like this place
is outside our times. The first brave daisies paint the grass,
announcing the start of this year's spring, toghether with many other
colorful flowers on display, with their descriptions on metal plates.
Pigeons are everywhere, to remind me the reality of the situation:
the nature here is human-made, those plants and shiny flowers have no
reasons to be here other than for show, being artificially kept alive
by us humans for our own delight.
</p>

<p>
Being situated in the city center, the park is a busy place, often
used to move from one place of the city to another. Lots of people
are passing by. Sometimes some people stop to take pictures of the
colorful flowers. I belive there is a kindergarden nearby so a few
kids with their families join the others in the garden, bringing
laughts and tears, emotions.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>My view of the garden</p>
</div>

<p>
On my right there is a fountain delivering fresh water. On top of it,
a bird is drinking the water. There are a few bird houses scattered on
the sides of the trees, I can see just one from my position but I believe
there are more since I can hear birds singing all over the garden. A
few ants and flies are moving around silently.
A bigger fountain sits in the middle of the gardan, but with a much
weaker water throughput and It is difficult to reach, just for display.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>The fountain on my right</p>
</div>

<p>
Looking closely at the ground, one can find many used cigarettes,
bottle caps, straws and pieces of plastic envelopes. Overall, the garden
is decently clean, unless you start paying attention to the details.
There are those automatic irrigation systems spreaded in the park, I
hope they don't turn on right now (It happened once in another place).

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Cigarettes and bottle caps</p>
</div>


<p>
The colorful houses that surround the park completely block the view
from the mountains. Maybe a glimpse of the Marzola mountain could be
seen from here on a nicer day without clouds. A flag of peace is
displayed from a window of one of the buildings.
The clouds have moved and there is no trace of the Marzola, sadly.
</p>

<p>
A dog and the owner are joining the park, playing with a ball. Although
the dog is more interested in biting the ball, with much focus.
Some drops of water are falling from the sky, the sun is slowly
setting and It is becoming colder.
</p>

<p>
It is the 25 of March 2025, 5:53pm, the spring season started a few
days ago.

<title>Sant Agata Church</title>
<link>https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/reading/surroundings/sant-agata-church.html</link>

Sitting in front of me is Sant'Agata church, or what remains of it.
Despite It's age, being born in the 16th century, the church stands
strong from the ground, challenging time itself.  We rest together
on a "Doss" which is a tall hill or bump from the ground, but too
modest to be considered a mountain, laying between Povo and
Oltrecastello. Everything is quiet here except the birds and the
noise of the cars from the city beneath.
</p>

<p>
Reaching the top of the Doss is simple. From Povo, more specifically
Piazza Manci, one can follow the street going east towards Cimirlo.
At the first opportunity, turn left when you see a SAT sign advertising
a walk reaching Oltrecastello. The trail quickly goes up for the first
10 minutes, and slows down for the remaining 15. Despite the first
half, the path is generous with many benches to let the explorer
catch some breath. Overall, the walk is easily accessible even for
elderly people, I even met two elderly women while I was going up.
An alternative route would be from Oltrecastello, following the
street towards Povo and turning right just after the main piazza
of the town. The path here is shorter but steeper. Obviously, you
could go down from either of the two ways.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Map of the path</p>
</div>


<p>
From up here one can enjoy a good view of Adige's valley, with Its
urban areas and urban noises, expecially the southern parts of Trento.
Instead, the small fraction of Borino and Cimirlo are perfectly
visible in their entirety, a rare sight since they are often hidden by
this same doss. Surrounding the hill stand the mount of Marzola on the
South-East, mount Celva from east, mount Calisio on the northen side
and the valley on the west. The snow on top of Paganella and Bondone
can be appreciated even during the spring, although this year the snow
has been very shy.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>View of the valley from the top</p>
</div>

<p>
Up here there is a flat grass area where you can enjoy the view and
some fresh air, with planty of benches and space to rest. Most of
the area is now inaccessible because of some escavations beteath the
ground. A long long time ago there was a fortress here ment to
protect the city from attacks coming from Valsugana. When the
fortress was not necessary anymore, It got dismantled but the
foundations still remains.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Archeological site</p>
</div>

<p>
Dominating the area stands a modest church made of stone and
concrete. The look of the church is very simple, with only some
framing around the two windows on the side of the wooden door at the
front of the house faicing west. The walls lack any kind of decoration,
displaying all ruthless of time like an old person. A hollow structure
on the roof hints of a bell lost to time. Despite It's size, the
church catches the attention and the imagination of the people coming
up here, wondering of the devoted and hard working people who created
it in a past era.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>The church view from west</p>
</div>

<p>
Peeking at the windows, the interior looks as abandoned as the
exterior. A wooden floor with some benches fills the empty space,
hidden by a layer of dust and the lack of sun light. On the back
sleeps what used to be an altar, retired from Its important job,
now discredited and disrespected.

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5: </span>Peeking at the window</p>
</div>

<p>
A good variety of flowers and plants surround the church, keeping
spring alive. The green grass is painted with colors of violet, yellow
and white.
