<title>Doss Trento</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
Here I am up Doss Trento, the closest elevation from the city center.
You may recognize this doss by the proud white monument of Cesare
Battisti looking over the valley. The doss feels smaller than expected
from up here, there are two main grass areas: one next to the monument
and another one next to a war museum. I visited the museum a while
ago, displayed were uniforms, weapons and tools used by the people of
this lands during world war 1. The purpose of this entire doss seems
to be to hold the memory of such a terrible past. Some scary weapons
lay on the outside, with some people standing over them as if it were a
bench. Other people come here to walk thee dogs or just to take a
breath.

<title>Moena - Passo Carezza</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
Today we hare taking a walk from the village of Moena in Val di Fassa
to the locality of passo Carezza, touching the province of Bolzano
beneath the Latemar mountain group.
</p>


<div id="org2edfdd1" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/moena-map.jpg" alt="moena-map.jpg" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Path taken on map</p>
</div>

<p>
The village of Moena is a beautiful place in a beautiful valley that
could enjoy some good peace if it weren't for the tourists. We park
the car just south of the city centre in a free parking lot (even if
some old signs tell otherwise). From here you can go to the north or
to the south following the river down in the valley next to some small
villages and localities. Alternatively, you could go west or east to
face some elevation and a better landscape from above. We choose to
go west towards the locality of Carezza, for an easy and enjoyable
walk.
</p>


<div id="orgef34823" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Parking lot</p>
</div>

<p>
Just after getting off the car, we had breakfast at "Caffe' Moena"
and visited the church. The inside felt huge and empty, as if it
could contain thousands of people but only we were present to fill
the space. We proceeded north-west to a beautiful dandelion field
where we took some pictures. I kept joking about the tourists taking
pictures here.
</p>

<p>
Off we go following the 519A.

</div>

<p>
The leftovers of Vaia sotrm can still be witnessed all around us.
In 2018 a powerful storm hit the region, taking down most if not
all of the trees of entire mountains and creating a post-apocalyptic
landscape. The view is terrible and it will take a long time to
repopulate the mountain with new trees. This is where we had lunch.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 6: </span>Destruction of vaia</p>
</div>

<p>
The path keeps going for 2 hours until the area opens up towards the
town of Carezza. The view here is majestic, it totally deserves the
walk. A little trivia: we went to this specific spot because it was
marked by someone as a beautiful view in an app, so every time we were
thinking of going back I went like "we need to see the beautiful view
that some random guy marked".
</p>

<p>
We enjoyed the view and went back from the same path, singing
mountain songs.

<title>Mount Celva</title>
<link>https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/writing/surroundings/mount-celva.html</link>
<author>Giovanni Santini</author>
<pubDate>05 Apr 2025 00:00 GMT</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
Today I decided to take a walk to Mount Celva. It is easily reachable
from the city by foot in about two and an half hours and it is only
998 meters high. Despite not being in the same status as the bigger
mountains, it has been a startegic place during world war I because
of its position halfway across the Val Sugana and the Val d'Adige.
From its top, one can see the entire Val Sugana and possibly any
enemy's army marching north. For this reason, the Austrians heavily
invested into fortifying the mountain with kilometers of barbed wires
and fortresses protected inside the mountain. All this effort can still
be witnessed to this day, making for an enjoyable walk through the
testimony of the great war.
</p>

<p>
Starting from Trento, we head to Mesiano and then to Povo,
Oltrecastello and finally Cimirlo. From this locality, one can choose
various paths, we are going to take the SAT's 411. You should know
that there are two parts of the mountain, the former being the actual
top and the latter being a lower area usually referred to as "Basso
Celva". We will see both.
</p>


<div id="org60dd7ee" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-celva-map.JPG" alt="mount-celva-map.JPG" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Section of the path from Oltrecastello</p>
</div>

<p>
Taking the 411, we start going up. The difficulty is easily accessible
to everyone, except maybe the last 20 minutes where the path is steeper
and rocky, with iron ropes to help the less capable ones. We meet a
park and from there we reach a well maintained Austrian fortress,
which can be seen in the picture below. There was a scout group when
I passed, the more experienced people were explaining some stuff about
the backpack to the young kids. They were talking a lot, I could feel
the kids being bored, it bored me for the 1 minute I was there.
</p>


<div id="orgb6825eb" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-celva-fortress.jpg" alt="mount-celva-fortress.jpg" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Austrian Fortress</p>
</div>

<p>
We proceed through the path and we see the first entrance inside the
mountain. It is a scary one, you don't know what is inside but you are
curious. Some voices inside me were saying "Forget about it, keep
following the path, it is dangerous" while another voice was saying "I
really want to see the inside and how far the hole goes". This time,
curiosity won so I entered. The ceiling was low, the temperature
dropped quickly and the air was humid. Some holes on the left or right
were completely dark so I grabbed a torch, other places were openings
to see the path beneath.
</p>


<div id="orgab196af" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-celva-cavern.JPG" alt="mount-celva-cavern.JPG" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>View from the cavern</p>
</div>


<p>
Peeking from holes, you could see the entire path I was going to take,
and I felt totally invisible. This reminded me that this place was
designed for war and for death, there was no way you could go through
the path without being noticed or shot at.
</p>


<div id="orgd5ad7d9" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-celva-hole.JPG" alt="mount-celva-hole.JPG" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>Peeking from a hole</p>
</div>

<p>
I went back to the entrance and kept going through the path I was
supposed to follow. After some time, the street splits: one part going
up and the other going down with the sign "Sentiero dei 100 Scalinig"
which translated means "Path of 100 Step". This one goes to another
fortress inside the mountain, this time deeper and scarier.
</p>


<div id="org18a61a4" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-celva-sign-100-steps.JPG" alt="mount-celva-sign-100-steps.JPG" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5: </span>Sign at the intersection</p>
</div>

<p>
The name is not misleading, there is a tunnel of 100 steps going
upwards in total darkness, which is really scary especially when being
alone. I started going up with my phone's flashlight, performing each
step as carefully as possible. The ceiling was really low, and it felt
like the steps were endless. Behind me I could hear two people taking
the same path as me, but decided not to go up the stairs. I really
hope I did not scared them by making noises, I surely would have
been incredibly scared in the total darkness, what an horror movie
that would have been.
</p>


<div id="org27eba95" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-celva-100-steps.JPG" alt="mount-celva-100-steps.JPG" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 6: </span>The start of the 100 steps</p>
</div>

<p>
But there was light at the end of the tunnel, with a big hole opening
from at least 10 meters above. This could have been used to transport
materials, weapons or people from one base to the other, but its just
me wondering now.
</p>


<div id="org831bff5" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-celva-hole2.JPG" alt="mount-celva-hole2.JPG" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 7: </span>The big hole at the end of the 100 steps</p>
</div>

<p>
Going back downstairs, the view opens up for the
first time, revealing a good view of the Valsugana.
</p>


<div id="orgead99a2" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-celva-view.JPG" alt="mount-celva-view.JPG" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 8: </span>View of the Valsugana</p>
</div>

<p>
Back to the original path, the 411, we reach the Bassa Celva where a
big area welcomes the hikers (or the solders). From here the entire
valley is visible with great clarity, with fortifications all around
it. The path keeps going upwards towards the top, crossing the remains
of the fortress.
</p>


<div id="org1b46f12" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-celva-bassa.JPG" alt="mount-celva-bassa.JPG" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 9: </span>Bassa Celva</p>
</div>

<p>
After resting some time and taking a bite of chocolate, I headed
downward taking the west route. Just beneath the top there is another
entrance to some dark corridors, I tried getting in but the corridors
where really long and disorienting. I got scared and retreated.
The rest of the walk back was smooth, arriving at Oltrecastello in
about one hour.
</p>

<p>
I sat on a bench in Povo Sale' to write this text. There is a public
shelf for books where everybody can take or leave a book, I always
stop by to check what books have changed. This time, I see a bunch
of kids ripping off pages from the books and throwing them to the
trees, that made me really sad. While I was in the bus I could barely
breathe as at least 30 people where talking loudly at their phone,
each one of them trying to be louder than the others so that they
could be heard well.

<title>Mount San Martino</title>
<link>https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/writing/surroundings/mount-san-martino.html</link>
<author>Giovanni Santini</author>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
Mount San Martino (~1400m) is located west of Bleggio Superiore and
east from Val Rendena, in a beautiful place called Giudicarie.  The
whole area of Bleggio is a place rich with history and legends. Once
upon a time, in the medieval age, merchants and popes would travel
through those lands to go north, villages developed, churches were
built. Even to this day, this place still holds the memory of a great
and prosperous time. In modern times, due to industrialization, the
valley of Adige began developing and became the main road to the
north and an important industrial center. Still, this place gained
something else, it is now a peaceful, wonderful place, respectful of
nature and life itself.
</p>

<p>
We begin our hike on the location of Larido, south of Rango (as a
sidenote, Rango is famous for Christmas shops) where there are places
to park. The path forward is not certain at the start, since there are
no signs mentioning the mountain top, so with a bit of trust we follow
the only path west going upward.
</p>


<div id="orgb4f4368" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-san-martino-map.jpeg" alt="mount-san-martino-map.jpeg" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Map of the hike</p>
</div>

<p>
The hike is a safe one, the overall height difference is 670m but the
rate of change in elevation is smooth across the whole hike, without
any difficult sections. We choose this hike because there is still
snow over 1500m so we planned to stay low (spoiler, we still found
some snow in unilluminated areas). After some time, the view opens to
the valley below, looking east. The tops of Bondone and Stivo are very
recognizable, dominating over the other mountains.
</p>


<div id="orgcd9bb13" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-san-martino-fiave.jpeg" alt="mount-san-martino-fiave.jpeg" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>View of the town of Fiave from the mountain</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>View of the mount Stivo</p>
</div>

<p>
Midway to the top, a grass area opens up. A few tiny, little one-room
houses are scattered here and there, one high up, one far down the
edge. The view here is wonderful, the sun shines, no car noises
can be heard. We spot a young couple enjoying their breakfast in the
garden, we say hello to them and shared a smile, as everyone does with
strangers.
</p>


<div id="org14a8000" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-san-martino-house.jpeg" alt="mount-san-martino-house.jpeg" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>A beautiful and peaceful house</p>
</div>

<p>
All of a sudden we reach the top, where a radio tower replaces
the usual cross we find in mountain tops. We stop for a break and
to have launch and some laughs.
</p>


<div id="org7a3113b" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mount-san-martino-group.jpeg" alt="mount-san-martino-group.jpeg" width="600px" align="center" />

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 6: </span>South view</p>
</div>

<p>
Descending here is easy, we take the well made forestale path, and
then we switch to an abandoned one which is barely visible. It had a
magical feel, as if we were in a forgotten forest with witches and
monsters, with dead trees left and right to disorient us.  We came out
alive towards the strada provinciale before taking another path back
to Larido, were everything started.  Before that, we took some time
to play with an horse.

<title>San Marco Garden</title>
<link>https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/writing/surroundings/san-marco-garden.html</link>
<author>Giovanni Santini</author>
<pubDate>25 Mar 2025 00:00 GMT</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
I find myself in the San Marco Garden. The garden is situated in the
center of the city of Trento, in the oldest part. The park is an odd
but beautiful place, a drop of green in the middle of buildings and
busyness. Surrounded by medieval walls, it feels like this place
is outside our times. The first brave daisies paint the grass,
announcing the start of this year's spring, together with many other
colorful flowers on display, with their descriptions on metal plates.
Pigeons are everywhere, to remind me the reality of the situation:
the nature here is human-made, those plants and shiny flowers have no
reasons to be here other than for show, being artificially kept alive
by us humans for our own delight.
</p>

<p>
Being situated in the city center, the park is a busy place, often
used to move from one place of the city to another. Lots of people
are passing by. Sometimes some people stop to take pictures of the
colorful flowers. I believe there is a kindergarten nearby so a few
kids with their families join the others in the garden, bringing
laughs and tears, emotions.
</p>


<div id="org08df9cf" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/san-marco-garden-full.jpeg" alt="san-marco-garden-full.jpeg" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>My view of the garden</p>
</div>

<p>
On my right there is a fountain delivering fresh water. On top of it,
a bird is drinking the water. There are a few bird houses scattered on
the sides of the trees, I can see just one from my position but I believe
there are more since I can hear birds singing all over the garden. A
few ants and flies are moving around silently.
A bigger fountain sits in the middle of the garden, but with a much
weaker water throughput and it is difficult to reach, just for display.
</p>


<div id="orgb03c25d" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/san-marco-garden-fountain.jpeg" alt="san-marco-garden-fountain.jpeg" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>The fountain on my right</p>
</div>

<p>
Looking closely at the ground, one can find many used cigarettes,
bottle caps, straws and pieces of plastic envelopes. Overall, the garden
is decently clean, unless you start paying attention to the details.
There are those automatic irrigation systems spread in the park, I
hope they don't turn on right now (it happened once in another place).
</p>


<div id="orgb26a454" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Cigarettes and bottle caps</p>
</div>


<p>
The colorful houses that surround the park completely block the view
from the mountains. Maybe a glimpse of the Marzola mountain could be
seen from here on a nicer day without clouds. A flag of peace is
displayed from a window of one of the buildings.
The clouds have moved and there is no trace of the Marzola, sadly.
</p>

<p>
A dog and the owner are joining the park, playing with a ball. Although
the dog is more interested in biting the ball, with much focus.
Some drops of water are falling from the sky, the sun is slowly
setting and it is becoming colder.
</p>

<p>
It is the 25 of March 2025, 5:53pm, the spring season started a few
days ago.

<title>Sant Agata Church</title>
<link>https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/writing/surroundings/sant-agata-church.html</link>
<author>Giovanni Santini</author>
<pubDate>26 Mar 2025 00:00 GMT</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
Sitting in front of me is Sant'Agata church, or what remains of it.
Despite it's age, being born in the 16th century, the church stands
strong from the ground, challenging time itself.  We rest together
on a "Doss" which is a tall hill or bump from the ground, but too
modest to be considered a mountain, laying between Povo and
Oltrecastello. Everything is quiet here except the birds and the
noise of the cars from the city beneath.
</p>

<p>
Reaching the top of the Doss is simple. From Povo, more specifically
Piazza Manci, one can follow the street going east towards Cimirlo.
At the first opportunity, turn left when you see a SAT sign advertising
a walk reaching Oltrecastello. The trail quickly goes up for the first
10 minutes, and slows down for the remaining 15. Despite the first
half, the path is generous with many benches to let the explorer
catch some breath. Overall, the walk is easily accessible even for
elderly people, I even met two elderly women while I was going up.
An alternative route would be from Oltrecastello, following the
street towards Povo and turning right just after the main piazza
of the town. The path here is shorter but steeper. Obviously, you
could go down from either of the two ways.
</p>


<div id="org6dd92cb" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Map of the path</p>
</div>


<p>
From up here one can enjoy a good view of Adige's valley, with its
urban areas and urban noises, especially the southern parts of Trento.
Instead, the small fraction of Borino and Cimirlo are perfectly
visible in their entirety, a rare sight since they are often hidden by
this same doss. Surrounding the hill stand the mount of Marzola on the
South-East, mount Celva from east, mount Calisio on the northern side
and the valley on the west. The snow on top of Paganella and Bondone
can be appreciated even during the spring, although this year the snow
has been very shy.
</p>



<div id="orgd154a9b" class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>View of the valley from the top</p>
</div>

<p>
Up here there is a flat grass area where you can enjoy the view and
some fresh air, with plenty of benches and space to rest. Most of
the area is now inaccessible because of some excavations beneath the
ground. A long long time ago there was a fortress here meant to
protect the city from attacks coming from Valsugana. When the
fortress was not necessary anymore, it got dismantled but the
foundations still remains.

Dominating the area stands a modest church made of stone and
concrete. The look of the church is very simple, with only some
framing around the two windows on the side of the wooden door at the
front of the house facing west. The walls lack any kind of decoration,
displaying all ruthless of time like an old person. A hollow structure
on the roof hints of a bell lost to time. Despite it's size, the
church catches the attention and the imagination of the people coming
up here, wondering of the devoted and hard working people who created
it in a past era.

Peeking at the windows, the interior looks as abandoned as the
exterior. A wooden floor with some benches fills the empty space,
hidden by a layer of dust and the lack of sun light. On the back
sleeps what used to be an altar, retired from its important job,
now discredited and disrespected.

A good variety of flowers and plants surround the church, keeping
spring alive. The green grass is painted with colors of violet, yellow
and white.

<description><![CDATA[<p>
Walking next to the Adige river close to Trento, one cannot miss the
church of Sant'Apollinare because of its height and Its oddity. The
story of this church dates back to the first paleocristiani, in the
6th century, and it evolved and reshaped over the centuries. Its
surroundings have changed too, perhaps more violently, leaving this
place as a monument to a past time.
</p>

<p>
The church is situated in a busy road just west to the city, on the
other side of the river. Cars and busses pass through here in waves,
briefly glimpsing the back of the church. Instead, if you approach it
from west or north-west, you would appreciate its front face and
dimensions. The church has a rectangular floor with the shorter edge
at the front and back. It develops in height by at least double Its
width, with an even higher bell tower. The exterior is plain and
simple, with the remains of paint suggesting some lost pictures
decorating the front. Up the main door there is a rosone, common to
many churches, and above it there are 8 windows placed symmetrically
on the left and on the right. The tower is attached in the corner
between the front and the southern edge.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>View of the church</p>
</div>

<p>
As you get closer to the church, you feel smaller and tinier, as if the
balance of importance and power slowly changes, making you humble just
before reaching the main entrance.

<p>
The door looks as old as the church, made with wood and metal plates
with figures places between the gaps.  There is a description of the
changes to the church throughout history right next to it. Briefly, it
was created round the 10-11 century where different groups would stay
here throughout the years. The bell tower still comes from this
period. Then, in 1250-1300 it was demolished and the current church
was built. Some decorations on the outside were added but were lost in
time, some inner paintings have been restored, as well as the floor
which was raised by 1.7 meters because of floods. The church is still
used for christian ceremonies to this day, and it makes Its own
parrocchia, together with other churches nearby.

<p>
Beneath the church lies a grass area, now flourishing with daisies,
and a park with various toys and benches and a board with upcoming
events. We are in the area of Piedicastello, one of the oldest places
in Trento. Next to the park is a museum called "Le Gallerie" where two
old galleries are now used to display historical testimonies and other
events. The content often changes a couple of times each year so it is
worth checking this place from time to time, the show is very different
from a conventional museum as they use sound and light effects.
</p>

<p>
Watching over us is the mount of Bondone and the Doss Trento, which
can both be reached from here. You can reach Sardagna in about 40
minutes but its not an interesting walk, from there you can go higher
towards Vaneze or go west where there is a really nice walk towards
Vigolo Baselga. It is about 3-4 hours between agriculture land and
towns in the valley, it is simpler if you go from Vigolo Baselga to
Trento since it is mostly downhill and there is a public bus to
Baselga. This path is part of a bigger one that goes from Madonna di
Campiglio to Trento and lasts something like 5 days.
