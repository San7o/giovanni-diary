<description><![CDATA[<p>
I was taking a walk in my neighbourhood, there is not much too see
here. A couple of small parks, some triees, and mostly residential
houses. Yesterday I was watching a live of Prod. in real time, he was
just answering some questions from chat. He is such an interesting
and unique person, let me elaborate. Some people know him for his
philosophy videos, I belive he has a formal education in philosophy
and he often records his walks where he openly shared hit thoughts.
He lives a simple life in the mountain, with little to no human
contact or even electricity. Some other people know him for his
emacs videos: he is a maintainer of some well-known pacakges and he is
surely very knowledgable about his emacs-craft. He brings this two
worlds togheter, this is why I think he is so unique.
I started to watch his emacs videos and became interested into the
philosophy ones. What strikes me is his self aweareness. Just by
talking, he uncovered some of my own inner hazards and helped me
get more aware of them.
</p>

<p>
[ Here I have redacted some pages where I reflect about myself, I
am still unsure on how much to share here so I will redact this for
now ]
</p>

<p>
Another point of reflection of this walk was history and searching
through old stuff. In the park where I usually go there is a small
wooden shelf under some stone structure. It is one of those shelfes
where people may take or leave any book. I always stop there to see
new books and If something interests me I would take It home for
some time. Some of the books are narrative, some of them are
didactical books, most of them are very old. What fascinates me is how
those pieces of paper can open a window into the past and look at
the world from a totally different prospective. For example, there
was a local newspaper from a lot of time ago, It was one of the
first with colored ink. It looked like from another era, totally
another style. I imagined how people reading this newspaper looked
like and I find It peaceful. I am attracted to a simpler life,
and I enjoy those thoughts.
</p>

<p>
[ Here I redacted some more pages, but basically I was getting
inspired to start writing some stories ]
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I am heading back home right now. I updated my todo list with
some stuff.

<description><![CDATA[<p>
I was reading the post "On the Stoic harmony with nature" of Prod
where he talks of phylosophy, I wanted to save It here for the record
because It was such an interesting read:
</p>

<p>
In Greece we have a saying that comes to us from antiquity: “nothing
bad not intermixed with good” (ουδέν κακόν αμιγές καλού). A liberal
translation is “there is no pure evil in this world as everything we
find that is bad always has some good mixed into it.” The opposite is
also true, namely, that all good things have some bad inherent to them.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
In nature things happen when they are meant to. Consider how trees
blossom when their spring arrives, bears hibernate during winter, rain
drops when there are clouds, and so on. No phenomenon can be decoupled
from its fundamentals and, by extension, no event can be independent
of the totality of phenomena. The same is true for the human condition,
though we may lack that kind of patience in our deeds to see how some
eventuality is the result of dynamics that build up over time.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
The Greek word for “nature” is “physis” (φύσις) which refers to things
that grow. They develop organically, as noted above, and have a life
of their own that is couched in terms of the cosmic continuum of life:
they are all coexistent and interdependent. To live in accordance with
nature, then, is to go with the flow of the prevailing conditions,
else to be adaptable. When trees cannot grow directly upward because
some obstacle is in their way, they grow sideways, circumventing the
problem.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the attitude of forcing things to happen, of declaring
our wants, and trying to implement them regardless of the prevailing
conditions. If the tree insists on only going straight up, then it
will perish. Same principle for humans. What would my life be like
had I insisted on becoming a footballer and did not show the requisite
adaptability to try new things and to ultimately find value in them?
I would probably be miserable the whole time, as I would be fighting
against forces I could not overcome, never to realise my goal, and
never to have the necessary openness to take in what the world was
showing me.
</p>

<p>
End note: thank you Prod for your wisdom.

<description><![CDATA[<p>
I just wanted to share a thing that made me laugh for some time. I
am currently developing a kubernetes application for my ""internship"",
most of the code is in go, and some is in c. I am not an expert in go,
however the application is INCREDIBLY slow to compile and it weights
A LOT for being just a simple client that makes some api calls to
kubernetes. So, I was reporting this to one of my "supervisors":
</p>

<pre class="example">
Me:
The only complaint I have at the moment is that building the operator
inside the docker container before pushing It to the local repository
takes 105 seconds on average on my laptop (i3-1110G4 CPU) and it
weights 92M which is outrageous (by comparison, my linux kernel 6.11.4
image is 16M), and I am using the default makefile from operator-sdk...
I guess this is because operator-sdk downloaded a big number of
dependencies but I wonder if the application actually needs all of them
or if they can be compiled once and dynamically linked later to speed
up compile times.
</pre>

<p>
I felt this was a reasonable thing to complain. I got this in response:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Well, I see your point, but it's considered a "feature" of Go to
produce a single binary, which includes all dependencies, but this
also makes the binaries huge :'D
</pre>

<p>
A FEATURE? I really don't know if I should take this language
seriously or just laught at It, beacuse many things are just laughable.
Being able to dynamically link executable has always been one of the
most basic things, It is incredible to me that people consider go as
a language for system programming. Maybe I am just too used to C, but
com' on I cannot have the most simple client of 92MB!
I still have the best intentions of keep learning and write ideomatic
code in go, maybe I just have to understand that modern software has
to suck to become a real go programmer.
</p>

<p>
Also I call this ""intenship"" with many quotes because I am basically
developing this application completely on my own, my teacher is not
even answering my mails. Many of my fellow colleagues are in the same
situation. Still, I was not surpriced since I always think realistically
and honestly I didn't expect much from university, but It surely is
sad. The funny thing is that the internship was supposed to happen with
a company, but then they said It could not continue with them for
various legal reasons (I had to move to the USA) so I am proceeding to
develop what I was suppoed to on my own.
</p>

<p>
Emacs lisp is very cool, I am writing tiny-rss and I am having a lot
of fun. Firther, today I have redesigned by blog and It looks awesome,
exactly what I wanted! It's really really simple, which I find
aesthetically pleasing.

<description><![CDATA[<p>
Today I stumbled across some really interesting things and I wanted to
share it via this document. If you know me, I am subscribed to quite a
number of mailing lists, one of them being gmane announce. There isn't
a particular reason why I subscribed to this other than curiosity,
messages are rare so It does not bother me.
</p>

<p>
Today a new mailing list was registered for the community around
XEphem. Now, I didn't know what was XEphem prior to reading this
mailing list, but now I am super happy to have discovered it. EXphem
is a "scientific-grade interactive astronomical ephemeris package".
The word Ephemeris comes from greek and It means diary or journal.
In astronomy, It refers to a book of tables describing the trajectory
of astronomical objects. Those books were used and are still used
today (in a more modern fashion) to navigate the sky and to study
celestial bodies.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://xephem.github.io/XEphem/Site/xephem.html">XEphem</a> is a powerful MIT licensed software with so many
functionalities and a look from the 90', you know this is a good
software. Even though It is practically useless to me, I started
playing with the program. Is is packaged on variaous linux
distributions and even on other operating systems such as FreeBSD and
Solaris. It looks amazing to me, I encourage you to take a look at it,
It is full of functionalities. Also the program is written in C,
beautiful C.
</p>

<p>
I then read the wikipedia page and discovered so many things. First,
cilivizations have been making ephemeris since the Babylonians in the
1st millennium BC. Moreover, the term "epoch" in astronomy refers to
a moment in time used as a reference point for some other astronomical
quantity, what is interesting is that the calendars used in astronomy
are not the same as the terrestrial ones, so sometimes there are
funny dates such as January 0.
</p>

<p>
Overall, it was fun going on a different place where I know close to
nothing about and be intrigued this much like a kid.
</p>

<p>
Some other interesting things. Someone made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1jhjgnu/the_book_of_the_church_of_emacs_satirical_ten/">funny reddit post</a> about
the 10 rules of the emacs church that was fun to read. Also, another
blogger I follow shared some photos of flowers in his city and I feel
inspired to do the same in the following days.
</p>

<p>
One last thing. Today Linux 6.14 released and the usual message from
Linus made me laugh:
</p>

<pre class="example">
So it's early Monday morning (well - early for me, I'm not really a
morning person), and I'd love to have some good excuse for why I
didn't do the 6.14 release yesterday on my regular Sunday afternoon
release schedule. 

I'd like to say that some important last-minute thing came up and
delayed things. 

But no. It's just pure incompetence.

<description><![CDATA[<p>
I did so many things this week, I don't know where to start.
</p>

<p>
I switched my window manager from i3 to <a href="https://github.com/San7o/dwm">dwm</a>. The cool thing about dwm
is that there is no configuration file, instead you have to change
the C cource code and recompile it. Moreover, dwm is very very
minimal and for most of the things you would need to write custom code,
such as full screen, startup programs and different tiling arrangements.
It is possible to customize it because it is very minimali, abour 2000
lines of code, which is amazing. I didn't read the entire source yet
but I will soon because It is very educational.
</p>

<p>
Another thing, I downloaded Wikipedia, at least some sections of it.
You can download wikipedia to read It offline, and I REALLY like this.
I am becoming more and more independent from the internet every day and
I am enjoying my offline sessions. I have written <a href="../programming/offline-programming.html">offline programming</a>
where I talk about this, I used kiwis to download and view the
compressed wikipedia data.
</p>

<p>
I tried to get into space photography by downloading some images from
JWST and edited them. You can download the .fits file from the <a href="https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html">mast</a>
portal, then you need to fix the colors with some stretch filters.
I used <a href="https://siril.org/">siril</a> for this, which is very powerful but I would prefer
something simpler. I then exported the modified .fits into .tif and
added colors with gimp. The result is not that great but It's a start.

<p>
Yesterday there was the nintendo direct where they announced the
switch 2. I am not a really big fan of Nintendo, being a PC gamer
for my whole life, but the interesting news is that Silk Song exists
and FromSoftware will release a new game similar to bloodborne in style&#x2026;
exclusive for the nintendo switch&#x2026; (sight). Also two new chapters
of deltarune (which I never player but I want to since It is very short).
</p>

<p>
I have been writing machine learning algorithms, such as <a href="https://gist.github.com/San7o/4bfe69a9e1eb251d5267d8b74ff73dda">KNN</a> and the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/San7o/da2efc84eb3e7c8bdbefbd540c8cfbea">perceptron</a>. I am particularly enjoying the math behind everything.

<description><![CDATA[<p>
I want to record some updates on what I have been working on, so here
they are.
</p>

<p>
In the last few days I spent some time into improving this website,
both in presentation and in the content. More specifically, I added an
interactive map in the Surrounding page using OpenStreetmap which is
pretty cool. Further, I am generating a PDF book by translating the
org files into latex and then to pdf, which still needs some work on
the typography.
</p>

<p>
This weekend I went in Mount Celva which was a very enjoyable hike,
visiting World War I fortresses close to the city, and I have written
a new entry in Surroundings. I have to say that I am really enjoying
writing this blog, I feel a slight sense of proudness even though I
know there is so much to improve.
</p>

<p>
I am getting into history, perhaps inspired by the walk in the
fortresses, so I started looking for ways to learn more. I concluded
that the most fun way to learn history would be to read directly
sources archived from the past, and trying to piece together the story
of the places when I visit them, similar to trying to discover the
lore of a videogame such as Dark Souls. You have no idea how much I
like this gamification of history.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, there are many preservation programs of old documents and
everyday items from the past in my city, with even an online database
(really unexpected from the public sector). I guess I will try to play
the historian when I have the opportunity. I really value the effort
people make to document history, I think It is a very important
thing. I also started watching the documentary series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2lJUOv0hLA&amp;list=PLR7yrLMHm11XAuYuZMPHPn9HznxQ40y_f">Fall of
Civilizations</a> on youtube which I really enjoy, episodes are more
that 3 hours long so It's a lot to enjoy.
</p>


<div id="org394baed" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/library-window.jpg" alt="library-window.jpg" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>At the historical museum's library</p>
</div>

<p>
I listened to a choir singing in a local church. The songs were from
the 12th or 13th century with some elements of instruments from the
14th centuty. Really fascinating, during those times the melody was
secondary to the words and was slow and repeating, leaving for a
contemplative feel. Churches were a natural echo chamber to power the
sound of the voice. It also reminded me of the videogame Kingdome Come
Deliveranche which I am following a gameplay of on youtube, I would
play It if I had time and a decent computer.
</p>


<div id="org4675e84" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/choir.jpg" alt="choir.jpg" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Choir singing</p>
</div>

<p>
I finished reading "Lunario Sentimentale" by Mauro Corona, It is a
testimony to a past time that is now disappearing, therefore It is
really valuable and It will keep living in the words of this book. I
will write a page on this blog soon.
</p>

<p>
This week I didn't do any programming except some lisp for this website.
On a sidenote, I don't feel really motivated lately so I am trying to
switch things up and try new ideas.
</p>

<p>
One last thing, I want to open a section for photography on this
website. I have hundreds of gigabytes of photos on various hardrives,
I want to put some images here.

<description><![CDATA[<p>
It's been some time since my last publication here and stuff have been
piling up, so here is a summary of what I have been playing with
lately.
</p>

<p>
For my Surrounding series, I am converting the org files into latex to
generate a pdf. Last week I wanted to improve the presentation of the
book to make It look more professional, so I started learning more
about typography and paging. While researching for online
documentation and learning materials, I discovered what is probably
one of the best latex books ever, <a href="https://archive.org/details/B-001-002-139">The TexBook</a> by Donald E. Knuth. This
book is amazing, it explains how tex works to an audience of any
experteese by having secions labeled by difficulty and experience
needed to understand it. It is safe to say that even if you have been
writing tex for some years, you would still have plenty to learn from
this book. Moreover, the text is filled with funny jokes and
interesting trivias. Did you know that the name "tex" originates from
greek "τέχ" which means both art and technology?
</p>

<p>
Since we are talking about greek, last week I became interested in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a> as a philosofy for my own life when times get hard, so I have
been reading Marcus Aurelious' Meditations and taking notes. Another
good source is Seneca's <a href="https://www.lettersfromastoic.net">letters</a>. Briefly, the doctrine of stoicism is
based on the idea that a happy man is a man that lives with virtue. A
vrituous man is someone that does not follow pelasure and recreational
activities, "To be violently drawn and moved by the lusts and desires
of the soul, is proper to wild beasts an monsters". A virtuous man is
someone that listens to everybody, that doesn't talk too much but not
too little, is thankful to others, rigid when he needs to be.
</p>

<p>
There is this idea in many greek philosophies about a "correct" way to
live, stoicism extends this by accepting what we are not in control of
and working hard on what we can. I have been struggling with this
recently since there are many things I have no control over which are
giving me great anxiety, and this period in particular is very
intense.  Almost three years ago I read Aristotele's Ethics and he
also talks about virtue in great details by identifying every type of
virtue a man should have. I remember trying to take the best of his
doctrine with me but I lost motivation and now I want to explore this
again.
</p>

<p>
One last greek thing, I really enjoyed the video about
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXNIgHov0Nk">The $2 Million Lost Book of Archimedes</a>. It talks about the history
of a book which contained some groundbreaking math research from
Archimedes and barely survived time.
</p>

<p>
Math is fascinating. Because of some of my university courses this
semester, I needed to sharpen my multivariable calculus skills so I
have been following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxCxlsl_YwY&amp;list=PL4C4C8A7D06566F38">MIT's 18.02 Multivarible Calculus</a> from 2007. I
have to say that I really enjoy math when I don't need to give an
exam soon.
</p>

<p>
Last week there has been a showcase of old computers in the library of
my university: original hardware running Microsoft's DOS and other
operating systems from that time. Computers looked so different, maybe
I am just idealizing a period that has been so important in the
history of computer science that I did not experience, but I really
like the esthetics. I realized that I didn't know anything about DOS
or old hardware since I have always used Unix-like operating systems.
Sadly there was no Unix in the showcase so I felt unacculturated about
the industry I should be an expert of.  Fortunately, most of the
computers were working and some had a physical manual, so I started
reading a manual and played with the DOS.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to create a simple executable "shell" script, which in dos id
called a BAT file. From the manual I learned to edit with EDLIN which
resembles Thompson's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(software)">ed</a> text editor (that would later turn into vi and
vim). The program would just use DIR to list the contents of a folder,
I would then execute it with BATCH but I failed to save it because the
floppy disk I was using was in read only mode. I gave up trying
because I was already at the computer for some time.
</p>

<p>
I reinstalled linux from scratch on my desktop pc, this time with the
automated installer because I already compiled It once and It took a
long time. Everything went smootly and the computer was able to boot
and connect to the internet in just one evening, incredible.
Hopefully the automated BLFS will work as flawlessly.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the joint between the screen of my laptop and the rest of
my laptop broke and I cannot open the screen much otherwise It may
break completely.  Honestly, this HP laptop really lasted and endured
a lot, so I am not really surprised that his time would come to an
end. Still, I am a bit frustrated with modern laptops, this is why I
only buy really cheap ones. I have my laptop on my back 24/7 and I
prefer something that is not a big deal if It breaks rather than one
of those expensive laptops with pretty screens that would cost me a
fortune. I grow up with a desktop PC so I consider the desktop as the
powerful computer and the laptop as a client / browser.

<title>2025-05-14 - The role of theater in my life</title>
<link>https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/ephemeris/2025-05-14.html</link>
<author>Giovanni Santini</author>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
Today I went to theater as a spectator after exactly one year since
the last time I step in a stage (and I was an actor!), which made me
reflect on the role of theater in my life and the fact that Its time
has come to an end for me. I feel like I have no interest to enter a
theater on my own and I surely don't have the time and mental space to
participate anymore. This moment concludes a journey of 4 years where
theater was a part of my life and now it's not, I will now explain my
journey and my thoughts.
</p>

<p>
I started theater in my last year of high school and I consider this
one of my bravest decision I ever did. I was a very introverted and
shy person (still am) and I was constantly blocked by my own self
doubt and a lack of social skills. At least I was doing great at CTF
competitions :). In the summer between my fourth and fifth (last) year
of high school I was at a point where I needed to get out there and
push myself hard, so I did and one of the things was joining a theater
class organized by my school. Surely the fact that everything was
setup by my school reduced friction. In fact, I consider myself lucky
because many schools do not have a theater group and mine had just
been created one or two years prior. If it weren't in the school I
probably would have never joined. So I was in theater, actually there
was a short creative writing class before that with the same people so
I got introduced to the group. My god that felt awkward at first, but
I slowly became more comfortable with the exercises and with the
group. By the end, going to the lessons was surely my favorite
activity (after installing Linux everywhere obviously) and It gave me
a lot of motivation and self confidence. I have to say that the
teachers were truly amazing, so was the group and the exercises. My
best memories of high school are all from theater.
</p>

<p>
But life moves on and I moved to another city far from home to pursue
my bachelor degree in computer science. My first year was a year of
great change and discovery, and I decided to keep doing theater. I
joined a local group I found via some fliers hoping to relive some
stress from university. But I was really stressed and pressured daily
so I could not fully enjoy it. Moreover, the experience was completely
different and instead of doing classic theater "creative" exercises,
we were tasked to create our own show by the end of the course. This
was a different thing than the previous year and, while it was not
bad, It was not great neither. I am perfectly conscious that the main
reason for why I didn't enjoy It It's my own fault: I was unable to let
go of myself and university was giving me a constant level of anxiety
and pressure that sat on me at any moment. The people were great too
but as I said I was the principal cause of friction.
</p>

<p>
It's now my second year of university and I decided to try theater
again, this time with another group. And none other that ATU which I
knew was the best of the best, and It was. I got selected in the group
and the lessons started, each Monday evening, in a huge theater all
for ourselves. This was a step higher than anything that I had ever
tried before, both in terms of "professionalism" and intensity.  And
surely It was intense, too much intense for me. The group was a really
active and strong one, I felt like I was the only introverted in the
room and that made me distance from the rest. Let's say that I felt
this distance increasing more and more as time passed, in particular I
discovered how much of a calm and silent person I am and how much I
really felt uncomfortable around such loud and excited people. So far
I have always kept pushing myself to get out of my own "cage" and
socialize with others, but this group completely smashed the limits
until It had the opposite effect of what It should have had giving me
a lot of anxiety. Furthermore, as the final play was getting closer,
the intensity of the lessons kept increasing. So were my university
classes and the date of the exams. By the end of the class, I was
totally overworked, sleep-deprived, stressed and anxious to the point
where this led me to a huge burnout. I was not meant to do theater, I
thought.
</p>

<p>
And so I didn't try again another year and I decided to focus on my
studies, leaving behind everything else. It's now been I year since I
stepped into a theater and I have to say that the distance between
theater and me kept increasing every day. The distance between that
life of constant stimulus and excitement, and my life of stability and
peacefulness are not compatible anymore. I never wanted that life, It
does not feel natural to me.
</p>

<p>
Doing all those years of theater has been a great experience of
discovering myself, the good and the bad.  As I transition from an
university student to a worker, I have so much things to think about
that I can't take some more. I don't feel like I have the motivation
since I am now driven by different ideals. Either way, doing theater
helped me change the course of my life and I will keep this memory in
my heart, with some bitterness and sadness that It came to an end.

<title>2025-05-15 - Writing Giovanni's Diary</title>
<link>https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/ephemeris/2025-05-15.html</link>
<author>Giovanni Santini</author>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
Today I took some time to reflect on how much I enjoy writing this
public diary. I feel like It is one of those personal projects that I
will keep maintaining for a long time, therefore I should take care
of making the diary grow organically while keeping It structured and
easy to navigate.
</p>

<p>
I dedicate some time every day to maintaining this blog, so It is
always in the back of my mind. This morning I implemented some
improvements, in particular I changed the favicon showing the letter
"G" from an ugly hand (mouse) drawing in an 32x32 grid to a cool
Blackboard bold letter. You may recognize the font since It is the
famous Latex's "\mathbb" to denote number sets.
</p>


<div id="org2fbdc5b" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/logo-old.png" alt="logo-old.png" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Old favicon</p>
</div>


<div id="org875074c" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/logo-new.png" alt="logo-new.png" width="600px" align="center" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>New favicon</p>
</div>

<p>
Additionally I included some meta properties on the head section of
the html in every page so that the new logo gets displayed as the link
preview when you are sending the link somewhere such as discord, with
a short description of the website. I then added some pages and went
back to studying. Still, I was not done for the day as I began
thinking about other things that could be improved and reflecting on
the project.
</p>

<p>
First of all, when I just want to work on something naturally means
that I am really enjoying It. Secondly, I like the long term goal
of the project of documenting my time now. As I was wandering about
how to improve this, I thought I could take inspiration from some
other people that are making a similar thing, so I began searching
the web.
</p>

<p>
Coincidentally (or maybe not) this same morning I saw a cool website
on HackerNews - <a href="https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/">Internet Artifacts</a> - which shows some of the most
important moments and innovations in the early years of the internet.
One of them in particular cached my attention, It was one of the
first blogs ever "Justin's Links from the Underground" which pioneered
the concept of sharing everything online. I thought It was cool and I
kept going with my day, but I remembered about this blog while I was
seeking inspiration to improve mine so I dig deeper.
</p>

<p>
To be clear, I don't like the modern way of sharing everything online,
in fact I am totally the opposite. I rarely use social media, maybe
once or twice a month, other than HackerNews or a bunch of mailing
lists. Instead, here I can write long form content and I can be more
thoughtful and considerate about what I publish online while
respecting the privacy of others. Something that I feel like is missing
in the dopamine-centric corporate-controlled digital world we live in.
</p>

<p>
I didn't know about Justin's website and after navigating It for about
20 minutes It felt like a huge maze. I watched a nice documentary
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxD4mqFtySQ">overshare: the links.net story</a> which tells his story and It was really
interesting, but I wanted to find something else for
inspiration. Again I started asking the internet and the internet
answered: I found some communities that referred to themselves as
"<a href="https://tildeverse.org/">tildes</a>" who are centered around a shared Linux server. How It works
is that you get access to the machine and you can start doing whatever
you want. This server then becomes a social place do share things and
do stuff together, really amazing and nerdy! Obviously I immediately
felt this was the thing for me and I started observing other people's
pages, but I have to say that the big majority are underdeveloped or
even empty. Still, I want to get closer to those communities because
they are cool.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day I didn't find someone to take inspiration from,
but I found some communities to get motivation and I feel lucky about
It. I realized that want to promote the routine of keeping a diary or
a blog through my writings and help others with the technical details
since this is waht I know best.

<title>2025-05-18 - Self Hosting</title>
<link>https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/ephemeris/2025-05-18.html</link>
<author>Giovanni Santini</author>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
for unknown reasons, today I woke up with a lot of motivation to self
host a bunch of services. And I know I have a lot to study and I need
to prepare for the exams, but I thought I could install some things
while studying (which did not work, but I at least I studied
afterwards).
</p>

<p>
Every time I think about self hosting, the first thing that comes to
my mind is the fact that I cannot do It right now: first I cannot do
port forwarding since I can't control the router of my dormitory,
secondly the router uses the university's network which blocks a lot
of traffic. This means that I cannot just open some port and access It
on another machine, even if I am on the same network. Alternatively I
could use a VPN, but It would probably cost a few bucks and I cannot
afford to have any more expenses now, especially for recreational (and
frankly useless) projects like this. This morning I searched the web
for free VPNs and I found <a href="https://tailscale.com/">tailscale</a> which lets me connect up to 100
devices on the same network with the free plan. I am not affiliated to
them in any way but I have to say that the service is amazing and It
works beautifully, kudos to them.
</p>

<p>
Now that I can connect to my other computers remotely, I can have some
fun. The computer I wanted to use as a server is my old desktop: It
has an i5-6600K, 16GB DDR4, NVIDIA 1060 3G, 1TB M.2 SSD and 10 years
of experience in the trenches. This was my first (and only) desktop
computer I got when I was 12. I grew up with It, I played hundreds of
games, spent days and nights on discord and It is still working
nicely. It has installed Fedora 42 on the M.2 and Linux From Scratch
on another SSD. So I booted up fedora, connected the network and ssh
into it from my laptop. Time to have fun.
</p>

<p>
Since my laptop is not really powerful, the first thing I did was
installing ollama to play with some models. In particular, I installed
llama3.2:3B and qwen2.5:3B (7B is already too slow, and more that this
does not work at all). The difference in quality from last year's
models is really incredible: 3B parameters were basically useless a
few months ago and now they are good enough to use daily on my 10 year
old computer, truly amazing. After installing the model, I wanted some
kind of frontend to use and I downloaded <a href="https://docs.openwebui.com/">Open WebUI</a>. Installing It
felt dystopic, It downloaded literally thousands of dependencies!
Then, after downloading half of the pip repository, you can run the
program just to download a few other hundreds of dependencies. All of
this for a website with a text field that sends the text to an api,
disgusting. But after all the application (to my surprise) managed to
run and It was working flawlessly. It is probably the most feature
rich LLM frontend out there, I have to say, but It is also quite
bloated. Still, I don't feel comfortable running an application that
depends on billions of lines of python and javascript code so I will
seek something else.
</p>

<p>
Another thing I installed is a minecraft server. I haven't played
minecraft in a while (at least a few years) and I know they added so
many things, playing It now would be like rediscovering everything
from scratch. But for for today I have plenty to do so I just installed
the server, joined to make sure It worked and moved on.
</p>

<p>
I then wanted some kind of filemanager, but my experience was even
worse than with Open WebUI. Most of the things I found online were
completely bloated and difficult to install. Some of them didn't work
because of various dependencies issues which I did not dare to
debug. Fortunately, there is some good and I found <a href="https://tinyfilemanager.github.io/">Tiny File Manager</a>
which is a single php file that implements the entire web app. I think
many project should take this as an example: you get a full file
manager just by creating a php server and accessing that file. Easy.
</p>

<p>
I also wanted to install <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/">cgit</a> as a frontend to access all my
repositories. It took some time and struggles, I first tried to make
It work with nginx but apparently It does not natively support CGI and
I found issues in making the communication to the socket so I switched
to apache and It worked well. I had some other issues with file
permissions which I sort of solved, wonderful.
</p>

<p>
Going forward, I want to upgrade my system and have a NAS and a rack,
when I will have an economical possibility. I would also like to use
my setup as a node to host some community services such as a mastodon
node or contribute to a research project like the CENR's <a href="https://lhcathome.web.cern.ch/">@home</a>
projects.
</p>

<p>
I am also taking some time to reflect on the importance of self
hosting and being independent from big predatory corporations. We are
all so dependent on them and this makes us vulnerable and makes them
money, If I can be a little more independent I will also be a little
happier.
</p>

<title>2025-05-19 - Setting up a local cluster</title>
<link>https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/ephemeris/2025-05-19.html</link>
<author>Giovanni Santini</author>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
today I spent most of my day setting up a local cluster for
kubernetes.  I thought this would be nice and simple but It wasn't,
let me tell you why.
</p>

<p>
The reason why I wanted to have my own custom cluster is mostly
because I don't like popular solutions based on virtual machines. I
have always done all my development in a cluster with Kind and that
has been awesome, Kind is light weight and easy to setup. However,
Kind uses docker containers and It works only locally. For my
application, I need to test It on various cluster topologies,
especially in multiple nodes running different kernels. I have this
requirement because my application behaves differently based on the
number of running kernels in the cluster since I need to load eBPF
programs in the kernel.
</p>

<p>
Well, I tried to use Minikube but both my laptop and my Desktop would
completely freeze. Minikube is incredibly resource hungry and a lot of
the drivers do not work at all. Additionally, I have so many problems
on running particular topologies with multiple nodes and different
images. I think Minikube is slow and heavy, and buggy. The
alternatives do not satisfy me for similar reasons: I knew that I
could setup a simple and light cluster on my own and have any kind of
configuration I wanted, like 2 nodes on my desktop, one on my laptop
and another one on my other laptop for example. So I started setting
up everything by myself.
</p>

<p>
My vision is to have any number of Linux images running via qemu and
KVM, all connected to the same network. The images would then run the
various kubernetes daemons and I would control everything from a
tmuxed terminal. All of this is managed centrally using a bunch of
scripts. Since I am bootstrapping everything, I have full control on
any part of my cluster, making It simple to hack. However, I have to
say that setting up this did not went exactly smoothly.
</p>

<p>
To make the machines communicate with the internet and themselves I
needed to setup some tap interface and connect them via a bridge. You
need to do this correctly in order to make everything work, my final
script to bootstrap the interface is the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #ff7f24;">#</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">!/bin/</span><span style="color: #00ffff;">bash</span>
<span style="color: #b0c4de;">set</span> -e

<span style="color: #b0c4de;">echo</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"Creating bridge br0..."</span>

sudo ip link set br0 down 2&gt;/dev/null || true
sudo ip link delete br0 type bridge 2&gt;/dev/null || true

sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
sudo ip addr add 192.168.50.1/24 dev br0
sudo ip link set br0 up

<span style="color: #b0c4de;">echo</span> 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.50.0/24 ! -o br0 -j MASQUERADE

<span style="color: #00ffff;">for</span> i<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> 0 1; <span style="color: #00ffff;">do</span>
  <span style="color: #eedd82;">tap</span>=<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"tap$i"</span>

  <span style="color: #b0c4de;">echo</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"Setting up $tap..."</span>

  sudo ip link set <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$tap"</span> down 2&gt;/dev/null || true
  sudo ip tuntap del <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$tap"</span> mode tap 2&gt;/dev/null || true

  sudo ip tuntap add dev <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$tap"</span> mode tap
  sudo ip link set <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$tap"</span> up
  sudo ip link set <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$tap"</span> master br0
<span style="color: #00ffff;">done</span>

<span style="color: #b0c4de;">echo</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"Bridge and tap devices ready."</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I also made a script to clean everything and can be found on the
<a href="https://github.com/San7o/hive-operator/tree/main/k8s-lab">project's repo</a>. Then I needed to setup a static IP in each machine and
&#x2026; It didn't quite work. The problem was that I also needed to set a
different MAC address for each virtual machine or the TCP/IP stack
could not route the packets&#x2026; that took a LOONG time to figure out
because nothing hinted that this was the problem. I basically tried
random things for 3 hours until this worked, wonderful.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully I endured that and now I am here to tell a beautiful story
instead of being ashamed of my own incompetence. Anyway, now I have a
bunch of VMs all connected to the same network that can ping each other
and the internet. Next time I will make so that they will
automatically install k3s (a kubernetes distribution) and we should be
good to go.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting thing I learned is <a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">cloud-init</a> which helps setting
up the userspace of the VMs from an external config file, which looks
like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml"><span style="color: #ff7f24;">#</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">cloud-config</span>
<span style="color: #eedd82;">users</span>:
    - <span style="color: #eedd82;">name</span>: fedora
      <span style="color: #eedd82;">groups</span>: user,wheel
      <span style="color: #eedd82;">hashed_passwd</span>: ...
      <span style="color: #eedd82;">lock_passwd</span>: <span style="color: #7fffd4;">false</span>
      <span style="color: #eedd82;">sudo</span>: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
<span style="color: #eedd82;">write_files</span>:
  <span style="color: #ff7f24;"># </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Enable password authentication in ssh</span>
  - <span style="color: #eedd82;">path</span>: /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/20-enable-passwords.conf
    <span style="color: #eedd82;">content</span>: |
      <span style="color: #ffa07a;">PasswordAuthentication yes</span>
<span style="color: #eedd82;">runcmd</span>:
  - systemctl restart NetworkManager
  - systemctl restart sshd
  - nmcli connection up static-ens3
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I find this very useful, thank you Fedora for letting me discover
this.
</p>

<p>
The rest of my day was spent signing an enormous amount of documents
for my internship and doing physics exercises at the blackboards in
my university until closing hour, had a lasagna and now back to study
physics.
</p>

<title>2025-05-20 - Struggles with NetworkManager</title>
<link>https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/ephemeris/2025-05-20.html</link>
<author>Giovanni Santini</author>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
today I continued what I left off yesterday with my local kubernetes
cluster. To recap, I am bootstrapping a local cluster to test a
kubernetes operator and I want to have full control of the cluster
while being easy to hack.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday I spawned up the virtual machines and connected them to the
same network, today I wanted to configure the kubernetes daemons but
something was pissing me off. During the first boot of the machine,
NetworkManager spawns up and looks for available networks for about 1
minute and 30 seconds. But since I need to manually setup a static ip,
It fails and the kernel boots with error messages, not really
pretty. Afterwards, cloud-init setups up the static ip, restarts
NetworkManager and everything would work on next boots. Still this
error was really bothering me, so I tried to fix this.
</p>

<p>
The root of the problem is that I need to set a static ip before
systemd starts the daemons, but I was not able to do so without the
daemons (for example "nmcli connection up" would not work because I
had no NetworkManager running). So I tried setting up the connection
files for NetworkManager and networkd but they would be read only
after initializing the service, so after hanging for one and an half
minutes and showing the error. This problem got me for a while. My
second idea was to disable those services completely but I was not
able to do so before the first boot. And I tried, I even set all the
/etc files with "NetworkManager" in the name to link to /dev/null but
that did not stop the daemon from starting up and failing, so I tried
to override them but that would not work either. I made sure there
were no other services that would depend on NetowrkManager.
</p>

<p>
I looked up online and I found out I could use cloud-init to setup the
network, so I tried that but nothing would happen. I tried to change the
configuration at least 20 times but I got no feedback so I started
thinking that maybe the network configuration was not being applied at
all. Some struggling later I found out that the network configuration
could not stay in the same yaml file as the rest of the configuration,
but It needed to be a separate file. Additionally, I needed to pass
this file to a program called cloud-localds via the &#x2013;network-config
flag. I was using genisoimage previously and it does not have a
similar flag, so I needed to use this other program. Very intuitive
things. So this finally worked and I have a static ip at boot time.
</p>

<p>
Maybe there were many ways to solve this, but for the entire day I
basically got zero feedback on my attempts. Journalctl would not log
anything, genisoimage would not hint that I couldn't configure the
network in the user-data file, It wouldn't say anything even for
spelling mistakes. NetworkManager and systemd was completely ignoring
all the files that I changed or removed, everything was a black box to
me. Error messages are important&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
So finally I could boot the images nicely, I can now setup kubernetes.
I wrote scripts to automate this, then I got missing certificates
and I called It a day, see you tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the day I studied flow algorithms and physics. A nice
patch for linux 6.16 promises to improve swap operations by 20-30%
which Is really impressive. Honestly, If I had infinite time and money
I would work all day and night on my operating system, but I have to
do things and start earning a salary so I will leave this for another
day.
</p>
