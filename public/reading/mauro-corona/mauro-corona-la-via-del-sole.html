"La via del Sole" (The road of the sun) narrates the fictional story
of an engineer working to achieve his most important goal in life.
Through this story, Mauro Corona wants to express his feelings about
modern society in all of Its forms. It ridicules capitalism and
politics, with a sense of hopelessness and sadness.
</p>

<p>
The story follows the work of an engineer of a powerful family whom
loves so much the sun that he wants to see It as much as possible. His
father is a rich man owning a marble extraction company with sites all
over the world, his son, the engineer, has never lacked a thing and
surely lived a life of abundance and vanity. The book starts with a
change of heart from the engineer who is tired of the falseness of his
life and decides to live a peaceful life in a mountain house
surrounded by books and his beloved sun. There is a big problem,
however, that is blocking the engineer from loving his sun completely:
the mountains obstructing the view. Therefore, the engineer embarks in
a noble goal to destroy all the mountains he could see in order to
clear the road of the sun in the sky for the liking of all humanity.
</p>

<p>
This goal would consume him until his death. The engineer, out of his
own selfishness, will use his money to corrupt politicians and shape
the world as he wishes. People tried to reason with him, but he is
helping humanity by freeing the sun and he, with his money, is
unstoppable.
</p>

<p>
Mauro Corona is surely one of these people who would try to stop him.
He manifests himself through different characters and his narration.
But even if the narrator described the engineer as the worst of the
worst, I think the engineer would not care at all and he would
continue enriching himself, destroying nature and teaching people how
the world really works.
</p>

<p>
There is one moment in particular I want to highlight. While the
engineer was still in his early stages of his master plan, he meets a
funny man with a binocular. The two start talking about the meaning of
everything and politics, but their views were so distant from each other
that each one was just asserting their views without any dialogue. The
engineer represented modern society, capitalism and selfishness, while
the other man represented nature, sharing and wisdom. I think this
summarizes the entire book, which continues repeatedly talking about
the same destruction over and over again. I guess this is how the
author feels every day.
</p>

<p>
The book started like any other "I will change my life and live in
peace in the mountains" but It surely took an unexpected turn. I liked
the book and I finished it, however beware that it becomes quite
political and It is very repetitive with his themes, which made me
loose some interest. Well, the theme is just one: about how much Mauro
Corona dislikes modern society and his values, as he often talks about.
