To start my anthology of Mauro Corona, I picked "La casa dei sette
ponti" which translated literally means "The house of the seven
bridges". There is no particular reason why I decided to start
with this book, any book would have been fine. I admit that the
length of the book (or Its shortness) may have persuaded my mind for
a quick read, I felt like I just wanted to get closer to the author
as soon as possible.
I read it in two sessions, between the 16 and the 17 of May
2025, but It can be easily read in a couple of hours or less. I read
It outside, to get some air.
</p>

<p>
The book is a fictional story, I knew this from Its description
online, but the places are real and It feels real, even thou there are
some "mysical" elements that are explained at the end. The story
is ultimately about the relationship of the protagonist, a middle-age
antroponeur, with his family. He lived in Pavana, a small village
somewhere in the middle between Bologna and Firenze, but decided to
leave Its family to find fortune in the city. So he did, and he became
a successful businessman, outsmarting (or buying) his opponents to
stay afloat. Often, when travelling, he would notice an old, forgotten house,
which seems abandoned and broken, but a fire was always on. He decides to
investigate and tries to enter inside It, only to find an elderly
couple kicking him off, saying that he needed to go through the "seven
bridges" by foot before he could enter the house. Some time later,
he did go through the bridges and, each time, he would experience
mystical moments of emptiness and visions of people. Those were
moments of his life, that he wanted to forget.
He wakes up in an hospital, after begin in a a coma of a month, goes
back to the house and understands that the elderly couple where
actually his parents, whom he forgotten. He decides to spend the
remeaning life with them.

<p>
What sounds odd is that the author never goes too much into the details,
It feels like the whole book was written in a sitting from an idea. It
is simple, It does not try to be the new bestseller. In some way It
is huble, much like the house and the elderly couple who accepted
their poverty and lived in peace, with half a roof. Additionally,
the story does not explain why the protagonist was attracted by the
house, neither the reason why he decided to stay with his parents.
The visions he had were about some moment in his life or in the
life of his parents or real parents (turns out, he was adopted) but
the author could have enfathised how living with this new family
was nice and warm to explain the final decision. Instead, the
protagonist feels attracted to his past and decides to stick with
It and sell his business to his competitors, who where really happy
of course. Inside the house, pride and money ment nothing, unlike
the city; here the protagonist decided to stay, "a choice of his
heart".
</p>

<p>
This story connects with me because I also left my home when I was
young and I very rarely see my family, like the protagonist, so
taken from his businesses and busy life. I sometimes have feelings
that I should come back, but they are often overshadowed, maybe
from the pride of being self-made or the chasing of success. Either
way, our roots are part of our lifes and we should give value to
them.
