I am always reading something. Most of what I read now is either
documentation, code, scientific papers and blog posts.  In fact, I am
a huge fan of <a href="blogs.html">blogs</a> and they are my main source of brain-bread.

I was not an avid reader when I was young, I'd say I spent more time
playing <a href="../videogames/videogames.html">videogames</a>.  During my last year of high school I took a
creative writing class, I did some public speaking, did theater and
I started writing a diary journal.

After moving in the Italian Alps, I began hiking which became a great
passion of mine. I wanted to get closer to this culture so I started
reading <a href="mauro-corona/mauro-corona.html">Mauro Corona</a>. I learned about <a href="stoicism/stoicism.html">Stoicism</a> as a way of facing life.

<p>
I am currently reading "<a href="economics/henry-hazltt-economics-in-one-lesson.html">Economics in One Lesson</a>" by Henry Hazlitt and
getting educated on <a href="economics/economics.html">economics</a>.
