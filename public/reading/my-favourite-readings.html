<p>
In this note I will try to collect the most influential and Favourite
readings I have done over my lifetime. This is in continuous evolution
as I discover (or remember) things.
</p>

<p>
In no particular order:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl.com</a>: this is how I started with 3D graphics, which
eventually became <a href="https://github.com/San7o/Brenta-Engine">Brenta-Engine</a>. It may not be the best guide out
there, but I would totally recommend it to anybody that wants to
start working with 3D graphics.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb</a>: collection of header only libraries. This inspired me to write
my own <a href="https://github.com/San7o/micro-headers">micro-headers</a> and to enter this "sub-genre" of header only,
easy to reuse libraries.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.learncpp.com/">learncpp.com</a>: the absolute best resource to learn about c++, other
than the great <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/index.html">cppreference</a>. This made me appreciate the language
greatly and motivated me to program more and more. C++ conferences
on youtube are great too.</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/">linuxfromscratch</a> book: compiling and maintaining my own Linux system
from scratch has been one of the best educational projects I have
ever done. I became much more competent and, I have to say, fearless
when it comes to compiling programs / dependencies and customizing
the Linux kernel.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</a>: great historical book
about hacker culture and the beginning of computing. A wonderful and
informative read, it made me familiar with the legendary names that
shaped the computer world.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual</a>: the
reference for the Intel architecture. I have nothing else to say,
this is such a monumental book that tells you how to use the
CPU. Super important for writing an operating system on Intel.</li>
</ul>
