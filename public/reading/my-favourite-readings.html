<p>
In this note I will try to collect the most influential and
edicational readings I have had. This is in continuous evolution as I
discover (or remember) things.

<div id="outline-container-orgb333fb3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb333fb3">Operating systems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb333fb3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Operating_Systems">Modern Operating Systems, Andrew Tanenbaum</a>: This is a great general
introduction to operating systems, highly recommanded. If you want
the best experience, get an old version of the book as it includes
many not-so-politically-correct jokes here and there that were
redacted in later editions, it makes for a better read. Other
introductionary books are all mostly equivalent in terms of
knowledge so you can just pick the one that you fancy most honestly.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/about/dennis-m-ritchie/chist.html">The Development of the C Language, Dennis M. Ritchie</a>: this is not
"The C programming language" book which you have already read
(right?), but rather a focus on its history and design choices,
narrated by the man itself.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge333274" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge333274">Graphics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge333274">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl.com</a>: this is how I started with 3D graphics, which
eventually became <a href="https://github.com/San7o/Brenta-Engine">Brenta-Engine</a>. It may not be the best guide out
there, but I would totally recommend it to anybody that wants to
start working with 3D graphics. The books covers the basics of
OpenGL and graphics programming in straightforward, blog-length
lessons that you can follow in a couple of hours. After getting
throught the book (after one week or two) you will have a 3D scene
with some lighting, a camera, movement, textures and models. It is a
good base to continue on your own with more advanced tutorials or by
yourself.</li>
<li><a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">The Book of Shaders</a>, Patricio Gonzalez Vivo, Jen Lowe: "This is a
gentle step-by-step guide through the abstract and complex universe
of Fragment Shaders".</li>

<h3 id="org37c93e3">General Culture</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org37c93e3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</a>: great historical book
about hacker culture and the beginning of computing. A wonderful and
informative read, it made me familiar with the legendary names that
shaped the computer world.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming">The Art of Computer Programming, Donald Knuth</a>: this books needs
absolutely no introduction, nor the author.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf3dc9ad" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf3dc9ad">Misc</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf3dc9ad">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual</a>: the
reference for the Intel architecture. I have nothing else to say,
this is such a monumental book that tells you how to use the
CPU. Super important for writing an operating system on Intel.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb</a>: collection of header only libraries. This inspired me to write
my own <a href="https://github.com/San7o/micro-headers">micro-headers</a> and to enter this "sub-genre" of header only,
easy to reuse libraries.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.learncpp.com/">learncpp.com</a>: the absolute best resource to learn about c++, other
than the great <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/index.html">cppreference</a>. This made me appreciate the language
greatly and motivated me to program more and more. C++ conferences
on youtube are great too.</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/">linuxfromscratch</a> book: compiling and maintaining my own Linux system
from scratch has been one of the best educational projects I have
ever done. I became much more competent and, I have to say, fearless
when it comes to compiling programs / dependencies and customizing
the Linux kernel.</li>
