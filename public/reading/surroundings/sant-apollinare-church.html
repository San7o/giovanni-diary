<h2 id="orgb164273">Sant'Apollinare Church</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb164273">
<p>
Walking next to the Adige river close to Trento, one cannot miss the
church of Sant'Apollinare because of Its height and Its oddity. The
story of this church dates back to the first paleocristiani, in the
6th century, and It evolved and reshaped over the centuries. Its
surroundings have changed too, perhaps more violently, leaving this
place as a monument to a past time.
</p>

<p>
The church is situated in a busy road just west to the city, on the
other side of the river. Cars and busses pass through here in waves,
briefly glimpsing the back of the church. Instead, if you approach It
from west or north-west, you would appreciate Its front face and
dimensions. The church has a rectangular floor with the shorter edge
at the front and back. It develops in height by at least double Its
width, with an even higher bell tower. The exterior is plain and
simple, with the remains of paint suggesting some lost pictures
decorating the front. Up the main door there is a rosone, common to
many churches, and above It there are 8 windows placed symmetrically
on the left and on the right. The tower is attached in the corner
between the front and the southern edge.

<p>
As you get closer to the church, you feel smaller and tinier, as if the
balance of importance and power slowly changes, making you humble just
before reaching the main entrance.

The door looks as old as the church, made with wood and metal plates
with figures places between the gaps.  There is a description of the
changes to the church throughout history right next to it. Briefly, It
was created round the 10-11 century where different groups would stay
here throughout the years. The bell tower still comes from this
period. Then, in 1250-1300 It was demolished and the current church
was built. Some decorations on the outside were added but were lost in
time, some inner paintings have been restored, as well as the floor
which was raised by 1.7 meters because of floods. The church is still
used for christian ceremonies to this day, and It makes Its own
parrocchia, together with other churches nearby.

<p>
Beneath the church lies a grass area, now flourishing with daisies,
and a park with various toys and benches and a board with upcoming
events. We are in the area of Piedicastello, one of the oldest places
in Trento. Next to the park is a museum called "Le Gallerie" where two
old galleries are now used to display historical testimonies and other
events. The content often changes a couple of times each year so It is
worth checking this place from time to time, the show is very different
from a conventional museum as they use sound and light effects.
</p>

<p>
Watching over us is the mount of Bondone and the Doss Trento, which
can both be reached from here. You can reach Sardagna in about 40
minutes but Its not an interesting walk, from there you can go higher
towards Vaneze or go west where there is a really nice walk towards
Vigolo Baselga. It is about 3-4 hours between agriculture land and
towns in the valley, It is simpler if you go from Vigolo Baselga to
Trento since It is mostly downhill and there is a public bus to
Baselga. This path is part of a bigger one that goes from Madonna di
Campiglio to Trento and lasts something like 5 days.
