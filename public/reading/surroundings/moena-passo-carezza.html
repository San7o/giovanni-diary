<h2 id="org7f81b3b">Moena - Passo Carezza</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7f81b3b">
<p>
Today we hare taking a walk from the village of Moena in Val di Fassa
to the locality of passo Carezza, touching the province of Bolzano
beneath the Latemar mountain group.

The village of Moena is a beautiful place in a beautiful valley that
could enjoy some good peace if It weren't for the tourists. We park
the car just south of the city centre in a free parking lot (even if
some old signs tell otherwise). From here you can go to the north or
to the south following the river down in the valley next to some small
villages and localities. Alternatively, you could go west or east to
face some elevation and a better landscape from above. We choose to
go west towards the locality of Carezza, for an easy and enjoyable
walk.

Just after getting off the car, we had breakfast at "Caffe' Moena"
and visited the church. The inside felt huge and empty, as if It
could contain thousands of people but only we were present to fill
the space. We proceeded north-west to a beautiful dandelion field
where we took some pictures. I kept joking about the tourists taking
pictures here.

The leftovers of Vaia sotrm can still be witnessed all around us.
In 2018 a powerful storm hit the region, taking down most if not
all of the trees of entire mountains and creating a post-apocalyptic
landscape. The view is terrible and it will take a long time to
repopulate the mountain with new trees. This is where we had lunch.

The path keeps going for 2 hours until the area opens up towards the
town of Carezza. The view here is majestic, It totally deserves the
walk. A little trivia: we went to this specific spot because It was
marked by someone as a beautiful view in an app, so every time we were
thinking of going back I went like "we need to see the beautiful view
that some random guy marked".

<p>
We enjoyed the view and went back from the same path, singing
mountain songs.
