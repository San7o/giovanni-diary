Here is a curated list of my favorite blogs:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b><a href="https://protesilaos.com/feeds/">Protesilaos Stavrou</a></b>: Prot is a well known member of the emacs
community, he is also a very unique person. He lives alone in a poor
area in the mountains, with just a few hours of electricity if there
is sun, and maintains various emacs packages. He has an education in
philosophy and a youtube channel where he mainly talks about emacs,
philosophy and him building his modest house. There is really a lot
to learn from a person like him.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://blogsystem5.substack.com/feed">Julio Merino</a></b>: I found him on hackernews and it really fitted my
interests. He talks about low level programming / hardware and he is
very knowledgeable about it. I find all of his blogs really
interesting and with an old school feel.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://www.antirez.com/rss">Salvatore Sanfilippo</a></b>: Finally some Italian here! Salvatore is an
exceptional programmer and the founder of <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis">Redis</a>. He is always very
interesting to listen to, he has a youtube channel and often has
strong opinions about software and work life, which I admire.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://lwn.net/">LWN</a></b> : The main medium for talking about the linux kernel other
than the mailing lists, LWN is a very important website in the
history and development of the linux community.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://people.kernel.org/read/feed/">people.kernel.org</a></b>: a collection of blog posts from kernel
maintainers.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/feeds/all.atom.xml">Eli Bendersky</a></b>: Very interesting, he often delves into math which I
really enjoy.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/rss.php">Phoronix</a></b>: The best news site for linux kernel related things,
after LWN. I noticed that whenever I was looking for benchmarks, the
best were always from a certain Michael Larabel, so I dig deeper and
discovered his website and his <a href="https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite">software</a> to do benchmarking, which is
totally awesome.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/rss.xml">Brendan Gregg</a></b>: Very competent programmer focusing on performance
evaluation. He created the <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph">flamegraph</a> tool.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews</a></b>: I browse HackerNews daily to see what people are
talking about.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://lobste.rs/">lobste.rs</a></b>: Similar to HackerNews, but more technical</li>
<li><b><a href="https://blog.vaxry.net/feed">Vaxry</a></b>: This is the blog of the creator of <a href="https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland">Hyprland</a>. Even if I
don't use hyprland anymore, he is a 10x programmer.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://arxiv.org/">Arxiv</a></b>: This isn't really a blog, but its a scientific publications
website. I am subscribed to some subjects and I regularly read it (I
mainly follow cs.OS, and some others for fun). It's my main source
for discovering papers.</li>
<li>Other programmers: <b><a href="https://www.bellard.org/">Fabrice Bellard</a></b>, <b><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/rss.xml">Fabien Sanglard</a></b>, <b><a href="https://kevingal.com/feed.xml">kevingal</a></b>,
<b><a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/index.rss">Colin Percival</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/feeds/pgessays.rss">Paul Graham</a></b></li>
<li>AI: <b><a href="https://huyenchip.com/feed.xml">Chip Huyen</a></b></li>
<li>Great Mathematicians / Scientists I follow: <b><a href="https://www.jeremykun.com/index.xml">Math âˆ© Programming</a></b>,
<b><a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/feed/">Terence Tao</a></b>, <b><a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/feed/">Stephen Wolfram</a></b>, <b><a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/feed/">Azimuth</a></b>.</li>
<li>I also follow many more people on Mastodon and on Youtube</li>
</ul>

<p>
And many many more, those are only a few mentions. I will try to keep
this list up to date.
</p>

<p>
To discover blogs, I usually:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>browse <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">hackernews</a> daily</li>
<li>stalker people in mailing lists / open source projects that I follow</li>
<li>look at <a href="https://indieblog.page/all">indieblog</a> sometimes</li>
<li>in general, be curious about the people behind the code, and assume
that most good programmers have a blog</li>
</ul>

<p>
I use <a href="https://www.gnus.org/">gnus</a> as my feeds aggregator.
