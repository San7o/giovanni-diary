It is really hard do find <b>good</b> blogs, especially the ones I like,
which are mostly hidden treasures in a sea of AI garbage content. Here
is a curated list of my favourite blogs:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Protesilaos Stavrou</b> <a href="https://protesilaos.com/feeds/">https://protesilaos.com/feeds/</a>: Prot is a well
known member of the emacs community, he is also a very unique
person. He lives alone in a poor area in the mountains, with just
a few hours of electricity if there is sun. He has an education in
philosophy and a youtube channel where he mainly talks about emacs,
phylosophy and him building his modest house. There is really a lot
to learn from a person like him.</li>
<li><b>Sacha chua</b> <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/">https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/</a>: Very frequent writer
and another famous face in the emacs community. I read her posts
basically everyday, lots of interesting stuff especially if you are
interested in emacs and random trivias about packages.</li>
<li><b>Julio Merino</b> <a href="https://blogsystem5.substack.com/feed">https://blogsystem5.substack.com/feed</a>: I found him on
hackernews and It really fitted my interests. The guy talks about
low level programming / hardware and he is very knowledgable about
it, one of the true OGs. I find all of his blogs really interesring
and with an old school feel.</li>
<li><b>Salvatore Sanfilippo</b> <a href="https://www.antirez.com/rss">https://www.antirez.com/rss</a>: Finally some
italian here! Salvatore is an exceptional programmer and the founder
of Redis. He is always very interesting to listen to, he has a youtube
channel and often has strong opinions about software and work life,
which I admire.</li>
<li><b>LWN</b> <a href="https://lwn.net/">https://lwn.net/</a>: The main medium for talking about the linux
kernel other than the mailing lists, LWN is a very important website
in the history and developement of the linux community.</li>
<li><b>Eli Bendersky</b> <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/feeds/all.atom.xml">https://eli.thegreenplace.net/feeds/all.atom.xml</a>:
Very interesting, he often delves into math which I really enjoy.</li>
<li><b>Vaxry</b> <a href="https://blog.vaxry.net/feed">https://blog.vaxry.net/feed</a>: This is the blog of the creator
of Hyprland. Even if I don't use hyprland anymore, he is a true
gigachad and most of the development of Hyprland was carried by him
alone.</li>
<li><b>Arxiv</b> <a href="https://arxiv.org/">https://arxiv.org/</a>: This isn't really a blog, but Its a
scientific publications website. I am subscibed to some subjects
and I regularly read It. It's my main source of catching up with
the state of the art.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And many many more, those are only a few honorable mentions. I will
try to keep this list up to date.
</p>

<p>
To <b>discover blogs</b>, what I usually do is:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>browse <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">hackernews</a> daily</li>
<li>stalker people in mailing lists / open source projects that I follow</li>
<li>look at <a href="https://indieblog.page/all">indieblog</a> sometimes</li>
<li>in general, be curous about the people behind the code, and assume
that every decent programmer has a blog</li>
</ul>
<p>
I use <a href="https://www.gnus.org/">gnus</a> as my <b>feeds aggregator</b>.
