<p>
Today I made my first irrational action since I am here in Linz. I
broke my streak of being a good and responsible stoic and I consciously
did something I would usually never do. Let me tell you the full
story.
</p>

<p>
Last night I didn't sleep too well and I didn't wake up fully rested,
yet I had to start my day anyway. My plan for today was to study
Algorithms and data structures for an exam on September, and get
groceries. The first went really well, I went to the central city
library in the morning, then came back, had lunch and studied in a
common place in my dormitory.
</p>

<p>
This exam is composed of two written parts lasting an entire year, two
projects and a final oral discussing everything prior; I just need to
do the oral and I want to study everything deeper than what is
required, as I always do, since algorithms are one of the most
important areas in computer science. Today I started all the way back
from the basics and studied the big-O notation, Its mathematical
properties and how to find the complexity of a recurrence
function. This is not enough and I still need to do many exercises. If
I have some more time I want to prove everything with a proof
assistant like Lean4, I am dreaming of this and hopefully I will start
investigating this soon.
</p>

<p>
This morning I also saw a part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2i1UQZ_CGA">interview</a> between Mr. Rip and
Salvatore Sanfilippo the great. He is the creator of Redis and an
influential programmer from Sicily, I will watch the whole interview
slowly since It is two hours long.
</p>

<p>
After I was getting tired with studying in the late afternoon I
thought I could go out to get dinner and get a few days worth of
groceries. However, I was shocked when I discovered that every single
food shop, expect restaurants, were closed during weekends 0.0
</p>

<p>
This is very unusual for me since in Italy all the stores remain
open, and I was used to getting my food on the weekend; but here in a
city of 200 000+ people all the shops were closed. Literally, the only
one open was the eurospar at the station which is 45 minutes for tram
from here. Unbelievable.
</p>

<p>
But I had to take my dinner anyway, so I quickly took the tram toward
the eurospar hoping to get everything I needed. During my movements I
am reading "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution", a really
great book about the story of the early hackers in the 60' at MIT. I
am really hooked, I also cannot do much else since I cannot use
internet on my phone outside as I have very limited internet usage
outside of Italy in my phone contract.
</p>

<p>
When I finally arrive to the station (after getting a little lost), I
find hundreds of young people - gangster looking - all gathered at the
entrance. Apparently this was really the only place open and everyone
was here to get some drinks&#x2026; so I stood in line.
</p>

<p>
After I could finally enter, I discovered that 80% of the shop was
blocked and the only open area was the one with beer, meat and
fruits&#x2026; this means that I could not get the things that I wanted, so
I took some bananas and went outside.
</p>

<p>
This made me quite dissatisfied, how is It possible that I have no way
to buy basic food in the city? Maybe Italy is not that bad after
all. With this feeling of emptiness, and quite a bit of hunger, I find
myself before a McDoanld's and I made the split decision to enter.
</p>

<p>
Now, I literally never go to McDonald's and I do not understand why
people go there. I can have a better and healthier meal at home for 1
or 2 euros, instead people pay 10 or more of an unhealthy amount of
burghers in a loud place. Yet, here I am taking a burgher myself, only
for this night, while reading today's HackerNews top post - and I
wasn't even full afterwards.
</p>

<p>
I don't feel proud of this at all, I consider It a stupid decision
that I made emotionally and I would have never done It if I took more
time to think. That money could have been spent much wiser in other
things. Anyway, here we are.
