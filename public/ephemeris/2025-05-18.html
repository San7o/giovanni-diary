<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc591b58">
<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
for unknown reasons, today I woke up with a lot of motivation to self
host a bunch of services. And I know I have a lot to study and I need
to prepare for the exams, but I thought I could install some things
while studying (which did not work, but I at least I studied
afterwards).
</p>

<p>
Every time I think about self hosting, the first thing that comes to
my mind is the fact that I cannot do It right now: first I cannot do
port forwarding since I can't control the router of my dormitory,
secondly the router uses the university's network which blocks a lot
of traffic. This means that I cannot just open some port and access It
on another machine, even if I am on the same network. Alternatively I
could use a VPN, but It would probably cost a few bucks and I cannot
afford to have any more expenses now, especially for recreational (and
frankly useless) projects like this. This morning I searched the web
for free VPNs and I found <a href="https://tailscale.com/">tailscale</a> which lets me connect up to 100
devices on the same network with the free plan. I am not affiliated to
them in any way but I have to say that the service is amazing and It
works beautifully, kudos to them.
</p>

<p>
Now that I can connect to my other computers remotely, I can have some
fun. The computer I wanted to use as a server is my old desktop: It
has an i5-6600K, 16GB DDR4, NVIDIA 1060 3G, 1TB M.2 SSD and 10 years
of experience in the trenches. This was my first (and only) desktop
computer I got when I was 12. I grew up with It, I played hundreds of
games, spent days and nights on discord and It is still working
nicely. It has installed Fedora 42 on the M.2 and Linux From Scratch
on another SSD. So I booted up fedora, connected the network and ssh
into it from my laptop. Time to have fun.
</p>

<p>
Since my laptop is not really powerful, the first thing I did was
installing ollama to play with some models. In particular, I installed
llama3.2:3B and qwen2.5:3B (7B is already too slow, and more that this
does not work at all). The difference in quality from last year's
models is really incredible: 3B parameters were basically useless a
few months ago and now they are good enough to use daily on my 10 year
old computer, truly amazing. After installing the model, I wanted some
kind of frontend to use and I downloaded <a href="https://docs.openwebui.com/">Open WebUI</a>. Installing It
felt dystopic, It downloaded literally thousands of dependencies!
Then, after downloading half of the pip repository, you can run the
program just to download a few other hundreds of dependencies. All of
this for a website with a text field that sends the text to an api,
disgusting. But after all the application (to my surprise) managed to
run and It was working flawlessly. It is probably the most feature
rich LLM frontend out there, I have to say, but It is also quite
bloated. Still, I don't feel comfortable running an application that
depends on billions of lines of python and javascript code so I will
seek something else.
</p>

<p>
Another thing I installed is a minecraft server. I haven't played
minecraft in a while (at least a few years) and I know they added so
many things, playing It now would be like rediscovering everything
from scratch. But for for today I have plenty to do so I just installed
the server, joined to make sure It worked and moved on.
</p>

<p>
I then wanted some kind of filemanager, but my experience was even
worse than with Open WebUI. Most of the things I found online were
completely bloated and difficult to install. Some of them didn't work
because of various dependencies issues which I did not dare to
debug. Fortunately, there is some good and I found <a href="https://tinyfilemanager.github.io/">Tiny File Manager</a>
which is a single php file that implements the entire web app. I think
many project should take this as an example: you get a full file
manager just by creating a php server and accessing that file. Easy.
</p>

<p>
I also wanted to install <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/">cgit</a> as a frontend to access all my
repositories. It took some time and struggles, I first tried to make
It work with nginx but apparently It does not natively support CGI and
I found issues in making the communication to the socket so I switched
to apache and It worked well. I had some other issues with file
permissions which I sort of solved, wonderful.
</p>

<p>
Going forward, I want to upgrade my system and have a NAS and a rack,
when I will have an economical possibility. I would also like to use
my setup as a node to host some community services such as a mastodon
node or contribute to a research project like the CENR's <a href="https://lhcathome.web.cern.ch/">@home</a>
projects.
</p>

<p>
I am also taking some time to reflect on the importance of self
hosting and being independent from big predatory corporations. We are
all so dependent on them and this makes us vulnerable and makes them
money, If I can be a little more independent I will also be a little
happier.
