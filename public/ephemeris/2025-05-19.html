<h2 id="orgacf6029">2025-05-19 - Setting up a local cluster</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgacf6029">
<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
today I spent most of my day setting up a local cluster for
kubernetes.  I thought this would be nice and simple but It wasn't,
let me tell you why.
</p>

<p>
The reason why I wanted to have my own custom cluster is mostly
because I don't like popular solutions based on virtual machines. I
have always done all my development in a cluster with Kind and that
has been awesome, Kind is light weight and easy to setup. However,
Kind uses docker containers and It works only locally. For my
application, I need to test It on various cluster topologies,
especially in multiple nodes running different kernels. I have this
requirement because my application behaves differently based on the
number of running kernels in the cluster since I need to load eBPF
programs in the kernel.
</p>

<p>
Well, I tried to use Minikube but both my laptop and my Desktop would
completely freeze. Minikube is incredibly resource hungry and a lot of
the drivers do not work at all. Additionally, I have so many problems
on running particular topologies with multiple nodes and different
images. I think Minikube is slow and heavy, and buggy. The
alternatives do not satisfy me for similar reasons: I knew that I
could setup a simple and light cluster on my own and have any kind of
configuration I wanted, like 2 nodes on my desktop, one on my laptop
and another one on my other laptop for example. So I started setting
up everything by myself.
</p>

<p>
My vision is to have any number of Linux images running via qemu and
KVM, all connected to the same network. The images would then run the
various kubernetes daemons and I would control everything from a
tmuxed terminal. All of this is managed centrally using a bunch of
scripts. Since I am bootstrapping everything, I have full control on
any part of my cluster, making It simple to hack. However, I have to
say that setting up this did not went exactly smoothly.
</p>

<p>
To make the machines communicate with the internet and themselves I
needed to setup some tap interface and connect them via a bridge. You
need to do this correctly in order to make everything work, my final
script to bootstrap the interface is the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #ff7f24;">#</span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">!/bin/</span><span style="color: #00ffff;">bash</span>
<span style="color: #b0c4de;">set</span> -e

<span style="color: #b0c4de;">echo</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"Creating bridge br0..."</span>

sudo ip link set br0 down 2&gt;/dev/null || true
sudo ip link delete br0 type bridge 2&gt;/dev/null || true

sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
sudo ip addr add 192.168.50.1/24 dev br0
sudo ip link set br0 up

<span style="color: #b0c4de;">echo</span> 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.50.0/24 ! -o br0 -j MASQUERADE

<span style="color: #00ffff;">for</span> i<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> 0 1; <span style="color: #00ffff;">do</span>
  <span style="color: #eedd82;">tap</span>=<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"tap$i"</span>

  <span style="color: #b0c4de;">echo</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"Setting up $tap..."</span>

  sudo ip link set <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$tap"</span> down 2&gt;/dev/null || true
  sudo ip tuntap del <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$tap"</span> mode tap 2&gt;/dev/null || true

  sudo ip tuntap add dev <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$tap"</span> mode tap
  sudo ip link set <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$tap"</span> up
  sudo ip link set <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$tap"</span> master br0
<span style="color: #00ffff;">done</span>

<span style="color: #b0c4de;">echo</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"Bridge and tap devices ready."</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I also made a script to clean everything and can be found on the
<a href="https://github.com/San7o/hive-operator/tree/main/k8s-lab">project's repo</a>. Then I needed to setup a static IP in each machine and
&#x2026; It didn't quite work. The problem was that I also needed to set a
different MAC address for each virtual machine or the TCP/IP stack
could not route the packets&#x2026; that took a LOONG time to figure out
because nothing hinted that this was the problem. I basically tried
random things for 3 hours until this worked, wonderful.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully I endured that and now I am here to tell a beautiful story
instead of being ashamed of my own incompetence. Anyway, now I have a
bunch of VMs all connected to the same network that can ping each other
and the internet. Next time I will make so that they will
automatically install k3s (a kubernetes distribution) and we should be
good to go.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting thing I learned is <a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">cloud-init</a> which helps setting
up the userspace of the VMs from an external config file, which looks
like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-yaml">#cloud-config
users:
    - name: fedora
      groups: user,wheel
      hashed_passwd: ...
      lock_passwd: false
      sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
write_files:
  # Enable password authentication in ssh
  - path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/20-enable-passwords.conf
    content: |
      PasswordAuthentication yes
runcmd:
  - systemctl restart NetworkManager
  - systemctl restart sshd
  - nmcli connection up static-ens3
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I find this very useful, thank you Fedora for letting me discover
this.
</p>

<p>
The rest of my day was spent signing an enormous amount of documents
for my internship and doing physics exercises at the blackboards in
my university until closing hour, had a lasagna and now back to study
physics.
</p>
