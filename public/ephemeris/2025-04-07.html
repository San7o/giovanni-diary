I want to record some updates on what I have been working on, so here
they are.
</p>

<p>
In the last few days I spent some time into improving this website,
both in presentation and in the content. More specifically, I added an
interactive map in the Surrounding page using OpenStreetmap which is
pretty cool. Further, I am generating a PDF book by translating the
org files into latex and then to pdf, which still needs some work on
the typography.
</p>

<p>
This weekend I went in Mount Celva which was a very enjoyable hike,
visiting World War I fortresses close to the city, and I have written
a new entry in Surroundings. I have to say that I am really enjoying
writing this blog, I feel a slight sense of proudness even though I
know there is so much to improve.
</p>

<p>
I am getting into history, perhaps inspired by the walk in the
fortresses, so I started looking for ways to learn more. I concluded
that the most fun way to learn history would be to read directly
sources archived from the past, and trying to piece together the story
of the places when I visit them, similar to trying to discover the
lore of a videogame such as Dark Souls. You have no idea how much I
like this gamification of history.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, there are many preservation programs of old documents and
everyday items from the past in my city, with even an online database
(really unexpected from the public sector). I guess I will try to play
the historian when I have the opportunity. I really value the effort
people make to document history, I think it is a very important
thing. I also started watching the documentary series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2lJUOv0hLA&amp;list=PLR7yrLMHm11XAuYuZMPHPn9HznxQ40y_f">Fall of
Civilizations</a> on youtube which I really enjoy, episodes are more
that 3 hours long so it's a lot to enjoy.

I listened to a choir singing in a local church. The songs were from
the 12th or 13th century with some elements of instruments from the
14th centuty. Really fascinating, during those times the melody was
secondary to the words and was slow and repeating, leaving for a
contemplative feel. Churches were a natural echo chamber to power the
sound of the voice. It also reminded me of the videogame Kingdome Come
Deliveranche which I am following a gameplay of on youtube, I would
play it if I had time and a decent computer.

<p>
I finished reading "Lunario Sentimentale" by Mauro Corona, it is a
testimony to a past time that is now disappearing, therefore it is
really valuable and it will keep living in the words of this book. I
will write a page on this blog soon.
</p>

<p>
This week I didn't do any programming except some lisp for this website.
On a sidenote, I don't feel really motivated lately so I am trying to
switch things up and try new ideas.
</p>

<p>
One last thing, I want to open a section for photography on this
website. I have hundreds of gigabytes of photos on various hardrives,
I want to put some images here.
