It's been some time since my last publication here and stuff have been
piling up, so here is a summary of what I have been playing with
lately.
</p>

<p>
For my Surrounding series, I am converting the org files into latex to
generate a pdf. Last week I wanted to improve the presentation of the
book to make it look more professional, so I started learning more
about typography and paging. While researching for online
documentation and learning materials, I discovered what is probably
one of the best latex books ever, <a href="https://archive.org/details/B-001-002-139">The TexBook</a> by Donald E. Knuth. This
book is amazing, it explains how tex works to an audience of any
experteese by having secions labeled by difficulty and experience
needed to understand it. It is safe to say that even if you have been
writing tex for some years, you would still have plenty to learn from
this book. Moreover, the text is filled with funny jokes and
interesting trivias. Did you know that the name "tex" originates from
greek "τέχ" which means both art and technology?
</p>

<p>
Since we are talking about greek, last week I became interested in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a> as a philosofy for my own life when times get hard, so I have
been reading Marcus Aurelious' Meditations and taking notes. Another
good source is Seneca's <a href="https://www.lettersfromastoic.net">letters</a>. Briefly, the doctrine of stoicism is
based on the idea that a happy man is a man that lives with virtue. A
vrituous man is someone that does not follow pelasure and recreational
activities, "To be violently drawn and moved by the lusts and desires
of the soul, is proper to wild beasts an monsters". A virtuous man is
someone that listens to everybody, that doesn't talk too much but not
too little, is thankful to others, rigid when he needs to be.
</p>

<p>
There is this idea in many greek philosophies about a "correct" way to
live, stoicism extends this by accepting what we are not in control of
and working hard on what we can. I have been struggling with this
recently since there are many things I have no control over which are
giving me great anxiety, and this period in particular is very
intense.  Almost three years ago I read Aristotele's Ethics and he
also talks about virtue in great details by identifying every type of
virtue a man should have. I remember trying to take the best of his
doctrine with me but I lost motivation and now I want to explore this
again.
</p>

<p>
One last greek thing, I really enjoyed the video about
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXNIgHov0Nk">The $2 Million Lost Book of Archimedes</a>. It talks about the history
of a book which contained some groundbreaking math research from
Archimedes and barely survived time.
</p>

<p>
Math is fascinating. Because of some of my university courses this
semester, I needed to sharpen my multivariable calculus skills so I
have been following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxCxlsl_YwY&amp;list=PL4C4C8A7D06566F38">MIT's 18.02 Multivarible Calculus</a> from 2007. I
have to say that I really enjoy math when I don't need to give an
exam soon.
</p>

<p>
Last week there has been a showcase of old computers in the library of
my university: original hardware running Microsoft's DOS and other
operating systems from that time. Computers looked so different, maybe
I am just idealizing a period that has been so important in the
history of computer science that I did not experience, but I really
like the esthetics. I realized that I didn't know anything about DOS
or old hardware since I have always used Unix-like operating systems.
Sadly there was no Unix in the showcase so I felt unacculturated about
the industry I should be an expert of.  Fortunately, most of the
computers were working and some had a physical manual, so I started
reading a manual and played with the DOS.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to create a simple executable "shell" script, which in dos id
called a BAT file. From the manual I learned to edit with EDLIN which
resembles Thompson's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(software)">ed</a> text editor (that would later turn into vi and
vim). The program would just use DIR to list the contents of a folder,
I would then execute it with BATCH but I failed to save it because the
floppy disk I was using was in read only mode. I gave up trying
because I was already at the computer for some time.
</p>

<p>
I reinstalled linux from scratch on my desktop pc, this time with the
automated installer because I already compiled it once and It took a
long time. Everything went smootly and the computer was able to boot
and connect to the internet in just one evening, incredible.
Hopefully the automated BLFS will work as flawlessly.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the joint between the screen of my laptop and the rest of
my laptop broke and I cannot open the screen much otherwise it may
break completely.  Honestly, this HP laptop really lasted and endured
a lot, so I am not really surprised that his time would come to an
end. Still, I am a bit frustrated with modern laptops, this is why I
only buy really cheap ones. I have my laptop on my back 24/7 and I
prefer something that is not a big deal if it breaks rather than one
of those expensive laptops with pretty screens that would cost me a
fortune. I grow up with a desktop PC so I consider the desktop as the
powerful computer and the laptop as a client / browser.
