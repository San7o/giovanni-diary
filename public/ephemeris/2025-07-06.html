<h2 id="orgcfa4150">2025-07-06 - Writing math proofs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcfa4150">
<p>
Nothing much to tell today. I spent most of my time studying
Algorithms, right now I need to read and summarize the chapters that I
am missing. This is the most energy demanding part but hopefully I
will be done in a week or two. Once I have all my notes, I just need
to get comfortable explaining the details and the proofs, which
usually takess a lot of time but It is less intense.
</p>

<p>
Today I proved the "Master Theorem" for finding the time complexity of
certain types of recursive functions, It took me at least half an hour
to understand the proof but I finally got It and It is nice. I spent
the rest of the day playing the <a href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/">natural number game</a> where you need to
write proof for the properties the basic operations in the natural
numbers (successor, addition, multiplication&#x2026;). It is very
challenging for me since I am quite new to formal proofs and I need to
build an intuition for how these proof assistant work, but at least I
made some progress.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I want to be able to prove some theorems for cryptography
like RSA and some other fundamental theorems from calculus. I know
that Terence Tao has published a calculus book with Lean4 proofs but I
didn't read It yet.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, tomorrow I will start working at the company, which I will
refer to as D from now on. Hopefully It will go as smoothly as the
last few days have (mostly) been.
