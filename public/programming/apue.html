I have somehow grown attached to this book. It set in front of me as a
base for my monitor for many years, so I am used to having It
around. Maybe I just want some UNIX influence every day.
</p>

<p>
Even if I understood nothing after reading the book when I was
in high school, It was the first technical book I have ever read
and It introduced me to UNIX.

If you want to learn about operating systems, I would rather suggest
the latest edition of "Modern Operating Systems" by Andrew Tanenbaum.
It introduces well all the concepts of operating systems and It is
a great read full of jokes.
</p>

<p>
Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment (APUE) does not focus so
much on how to make operating systems, instead it explains how UNIX
systems work following the POSIX standards: how do permission works,
how about file descriptors or processes, how singnals work in POSIX,
etc.
</p>

<p>
The book is a great reference for UNIX systems, with many examples,
exercises and historical clarifications. For a more diluted version I
would suggest "The Unix Programming Environment Book" by Brian
Kernighan, which focuses on the user interface with the system. APUE
goes a level deeper and explains how It all works under the hood.
</p>

<p>
The topics discussed are the following: UNIX standardization, file
I/O, files and directories, standard I/O library, system files,
process environment, process control (fork, etc&#x2026;), process
relationships (groups, logins&#x2026;), signals, threads, thread control,
daemon processes, advanced I/O, interprocess communication, network
sockets, advanced IPC, terminal I/O, pseudo terminal. The book ends
a sample of a printer driver in 48 pages (literally, there are 48 pages
of code).
</p>

<p>
I will read It again when I will implement my own UNIX operating
system.
