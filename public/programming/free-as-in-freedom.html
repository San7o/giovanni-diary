As a programmer, I believe in the principles of free software:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does
your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a
precondition for this.</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a
precondition for this.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I always tend towards free and open source software for my personal
use, reducing the amount of propretary technologies to its minimum.
</p>

<p>
Living in a free software world is completely doable. Linux (or BSDs)
are great and powerful operating systems. You have the freedom to
manage your own system the way you want: use a FOSS file editor (vim,
emacs, nano), window manager (i3, dwm&#x2026;), editing software (gimp,
krita, kdenlive), you can self host open source services on your
machine to manage photos or websites. And many more.
</p>

<p>
We are full of great FOSS software and it is improving every day
thanks to the great effort of the community.
