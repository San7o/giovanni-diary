This documents contains notes regarding my attempts to increase
battery life on my linux laptop[s]. I don't use my laptop for
computational-expensive tasks, I'd rather prefer the battery to last
longer. Here is a list of things I did to optimize for lower power
consumption.

<h4 id="org1686db0">ACPI Specification</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1686db0">
<p>
Before tinkering with your system, you should have a decent
understanding of how the operating system works in the context of
power management. I will now give you a quick overview of power
consumption on a linux system running on the x86 architecture.
</p>

<p>
Let's start with the hardware and how we can interact with It, more
specifically the CPU. Similarly to other hardware components, intel
CPUs implement the <a href="https://uefi.org/htmlspecs/ACPI_Spec_6_4_html/">ACPI</a> specification which enables an ACPI compatible
operating system to interface with hardware devices to fine tune
performance.
</p>

<p>
For processors, ACPI defines different power states within the global
working state G0, and they are called "Cx states": C0 means that the
processor is executing instructions, C1 to Cn are sleeping states
where the processor consumes less; C3 consumes less than C2 which
consumes less than C1 (but this is not specified from C4 to Cn).
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, ACPI defines "Px states" which are other states inside
C0, where P0 is maximum performance. Operating systems can change the
performance state of a core "on the fly" which is known as CPU
throttling, giving us more opportunity for optimizations.
</p>

<p>
Hardware may send interrupts that can wake up a processor from a
sleeping or low-power state, therefore you should try to minimize the
number of interrupts (by disabling devices) or balance them
efficiently across cores (using something like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/irqbalance">irqbalance</a>, for
example).
</p>

<p>
Going back to ACPI, other devices are also a great source of power
consumption. Hardware other than processors have "device power states"
D0 to D3 where D0 means that the device is fully on, D3 that It is
off. ACPI further defines those states for many device types (network,
storage&#x2026;).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf32ddc5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf32ddc5">Linux's ACPI</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf32ddc5">
<p>
An overview of the Linux's ACPI implementation can be found <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2005/ols2005v1-pages-59-76.pdf">here</a>.
Briefly, It is composed of an OS Service Layer which abstracts the
hardware, an user interface via sysfs and procfs, the core
implementation which includes an AML interpreter which is used as a
language between the firmware and the operating system, and other
components.
</p>

<p>
On Linux, userspace can interact with the ACPI subsystem via sysfs in
<code>/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00</code> or <code>/sys/bus/acpi/devices</code> (if ACPI support
is enabled). Inside, you will find directories that represent ACPI
devices, for each device the directory contains information about
them such as the status or the voltage. You may want to use something
like <code>acpid</code> or <code>upower</code> to dump ACPI info, if you are using some
linux distribution you may have something similar already installed.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, the more stuff you are doing with your computer, the more
energy It will consume. You should prefer light software compiled to
machine code, with optimizations enabled and stripped debug
information. We will discuss more what other optimizations you can
implement.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf1613e4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf1613e4">Understand what consumes the most</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf1613e4">
<p>
While you may try to thinker with configuration files and settings
following common heuristics (such as "less processes = less power
consumption"), It is more productive to evaluate the power consumption
of your operating system and make changes to the most power-draining
sources in order to have a greater impact on the overall power
consumption.
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org48a40b2"></a>Powertop<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org48a40b2">
<p>
A general tool that works well is <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/powertop">powertop</a> which will give you
per-process power consumption and information about CPU states,
devices and tunable settings to decrease power consumption. It is good
practice to calibrate the tool with <code>powertop --calibrate</code> (only on
laptops) before collecting data, this will setup the tool to show
correct estimations about power consumption.
</p>

<p>
From the overview tab you can easily see which processes are consuming
more power so that you can look into them individually.  For example,
If you find that systemd is logging too much, try to increase the time
between logs, and so on.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org245026c"></a>Iotop<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org245026c">
<p>
Another useful tool is <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/iotop.8.html">iotop</a> which will give you information about
disk usage. Even though this does not directly list power
consumption, there is a correlation between disk usage and power
consumption so it is beneficial to look into this.
</p>

<p>
You may start playing around with filesystems and mount options,
later we'll see an option in BTRFS that improves performance.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgcb6da7d"></a>Plot power usage<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgcb6da7d">
<p>
To evaluate a change in your system, you can log and graph different
statistics and compare changes. The following script records
Watts consumption each second:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-lua"><span style="color: #ff7f24;">#!/bin/bash</span>

prev_energy=$(&lt; /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/energy_uj)
prev_time=$(date +%s)

<span style="color: #00ffff;">while</span> <span style="color: #7fffd4;">true</span>; <span style="color: #00ffff;">do</span>
    sleep <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$INTERVAL"</span>

    curr_energy=$(&lt; /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/energy_uj)
    curr_time=$(date +%s)

    delta_energy=$((curr_energy - prev_energy))
    delta_time=$((curr_time - prev_time))

    # Handle energy wraparound (32-bit counter)
    <span style="color: #00ffff;">if</span> <span style="color: #ffa07a;">[[ $delta_energy -lt 0 ]]</span>; <span style="color: #00ffff;">then</span>
        delta_energy=$(( (2**32 + delta_energy) ))
    fi

    # Convert to watts
    power=$(awk <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"BEGIN { printf \"%.2f\", ($delta_energy / 1000000) / $delta_time }"</span>)
    timestamp=$(date +<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"%H:%M:%S"</span>)
    echo <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$timestamp,$power"</span> &gt;&gt; <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"$OUTFILE"</span>

    prev_energy=$curr_energy
    prev_time=$curr_time
done
</pre>
</div>

You can then graph it with gnuplot:

<h4 id="orgd237204">Save yourself time: TLP</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd237204">
<p>
To save yourself some time configuring your system, you can use <a href="https://linrunner.de/tlp/introduction.html">TLP</a>
(or any similar tool) which automatically configures the kernel with
power saving settings. It is supposed to work well out of the box but
you can manually configure the settings via a configuration file in
<code>/etc/tlp.conf</code>. Please refer to the <a href="https://linrunner.de/tlp/index.html">documentation</a> for further
details.
</p>

<p>
The installation is quite strait forward, check your package
manager. To apply a power profile, run the following
command (do this every time you change the configuration file):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo tlp start
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To get system information and the status of the tool, run the
following:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">tlp-stat -s
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There are plenty of utilities like this, use them at your own risk.

<div id="outline-container-org8fc62ff" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8fc62ff">Kernel Settings</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8fc62ff">
<p>
There are many settings you can tune on linux, which will mostly
depend on your hardware and drivers. A decent list can be found in the
Archlinux's <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management">Power Management</a> page.
</p>

<p>
To access the ACPI subsystem you need to have the following
enabled in your <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Power_management/Guide">kernel</a>:
</p>

<pre class="example">

<p>
Additionally, enable Thermal and Powercap sysfs for your CPU:
</p>

<pre class="example">

</p>

<pre class="example">

<p>
Now you should have all the requirements to start playing with
the settings, <code>tlp.conf</code> is a good place to start.
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org2dbe9ba"></a>Frequency Scaling<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2dbe9ba">
<p>
You can choose a frequency scaling governor to manage throttling.
This will dynamically change the clock's frequency and voltage
configuration via P-states. Assuming you are using TLP, to list the
available governors you can run:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo tlp-stat -p | grep governor
</pre>
</div>

<p>
By default, Fedora 41 has "performance" and "powersave", so I choose
powersave in tlp's settings (which is the default setting).
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org8a5a5e0"></a>Maximum charge level<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org8a5a5e0">
<p>
To increase battery life, It is recommended to reduce the maximum
charge level below 100% and prevent the charging process to happen for
every short discharge from the maximum. By default, TLP does not set
this. To enable it, set the variables <code>START_CHARGE_THRESH_BATx</code> and
<code>START_CHARGE_THRESH_BATx</code> to something like <code>75</code> and <code>80</code>, where <code>x</code>
represent the number of the battery in your laptop.  Sadly, on some
laptops (like my HP one) this is not supported and the command
<code>tlp-stat -b</code> would output
<code>/sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_control_start_threshold (not available)</code>.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgbfc3bbb"></a>Omit Scheduling-Clock ticks for idle CPUs<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgbfc3bbb">
<p>
If you are doing mostly lightweight work with long idle periods, you
can limit the scheduling-clock interrupt to prevent waking up some
cores when It is not needed. The linux kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/timers/no_hz.html#omit-scheduling-clock-ticks-for-cpus-with-only-one-runnable-task">documentation</a> says that
if scheduling is set to periodic, the system would drain 2-3 times
faster compared to a kernel with this disabled, so It is quite a big
deal. You may need it if you are running aggressive real-time
response constraints, but this is not our case.
</p>

<p>
Enable the following in your kernel configuration:
</p>

<pre class="example">
CONFIG_NO_HZ_IDLE=y
CONFIG_HZ_100=y 
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgc4b9c71"></a>Disable Atime in BTRFS<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc4b9c71">
<p>
BTRFS is a popular filesystem. A part of Its design is the CoW
(Copy on Write) where a certain file would get copied in another
location when a modification is made, this is necessary for
the snapshotting functionality of the filesystem. However, this
causes the problem where a file would get copied even if you
just read it, just by updating the last access timestamp. <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/499293/">This</a>
LWN article from Jonathan Corbet explains this well:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If somebody takes a snapshot of a filesystem, then performs a
recursive grep on that filesystem, the last-access time of every
file touched may be updated. That, in turn, can cause copy-on-write
operations on each file's inode structure, with the result that many
or all of the inodes in the filesystem may be duplicated. That can
increase the space consumption of the filesystem considerably;
Alexander posted an example where a recursive grep caused 2.2GB of
free space to disappear. That is a surprising result for what is
meant to be a read-only operation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To disable the Atime feature, you need to put the <code>noatime</code> option
on the BTRFS entries in <code>/etc/fstab</code>.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="org2bf65de"></a>Kernel Flags<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2bf65de">
<p>
You can add the following kernel flags when booting your system:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>pcie_aspm=force</code>: force PCIe Active State Power Management
to put PCIe devices into low-power states. Some devices may
stop working if they are not implemented correctly, so do your
own tests.</li>
<li>For intel GPUs:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>i915.enable_dc=2</code>: enable the display engine to enter
low-power states.</li>
<li><code>i915.enable_fbc=1</code>: enables Frame Buffer Compression (FBC),
reducing memory bandwidth when the screen content is static</li>
<li><code>i915.enable_psr=1</code>: enables Panel Self Refresh (PSR) — lets the
display refresh from its own memory instead of continuously
redrawing.</li>

<div id="outline-container-org4adebf3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4adebf3">Helpful tips</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4adebf3">
<p>
Here is a list of other helpful things that will make your operating
system lighter and more efficient.
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org7129b98"></a>Light graphical session<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org7129b98">
<p>
If you are using a graphical environment, chances are that you do not
need a full blown desktop environment to manage the position of your
windows. The lighter your window manager, the better. My argument is
that all you need is a program that can create windows and move them;
such program should be simple and small, understandable and hackable.
Everything else is bloated software, I would suggest something like
<a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> or <a href="https://www.ctwm.org/index.html">ctwm</a>.
</p>

<p>
I did not compare Wayland-based window managers against X11, I found
some benchmarks <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/GNOME-Xorg-Wayland-AMD-Renoir">online</a> and they are similar in power consumption but
the benchmarks were made with Gnome. Unless you find a really minimal
window manager using wayland, the good old simple X11 window managers
are the best.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="orgd2f1957"></a>Have less background processes running<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgd2f1957">
<p>
If you are using a linux distribution instead of compiling your system
on your own, chances are that the maintainers of said distribution
have enabled a bunch of stuff you don't really need. This goes from
kernel modules for various hardware, which you do not need, to
background daemons to do things like reporting crashes.
</p>

<p>
If your system uses systemd, you can check active services using the
<code>systemctl status</code> command. Even though many of them may be idle and
may not contribute much to the overall power consumption, they still
consume resources so It is helpful to have less things running in
your system.
</p>

<p>
Disable things like Bluetooth if you don't need it, crash reporting
daemons, etc&#x2026;
