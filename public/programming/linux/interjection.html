<p>
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What I'm refering to as
Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it,
GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but
rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made
useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system
components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
</p>

<p>
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every
day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the
version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and
many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system,
developed by the GNU Project.
</p>

<p>
There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just
a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the
system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs
that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system,
but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a
complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with
the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux
added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really
distributions of GNU/Linux!
