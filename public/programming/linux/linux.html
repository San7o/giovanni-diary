In high school I participated in a cybersecurity course and played
CTFs, this was a big step up in my learning journey. I began using
Kali <a href="interjection.html">Linux</a> for the competitions, I then continued to use Linux
daily. I installed Arch Linux manually for the first time on
summer 2021.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to be like the cool nerds at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/top/?t=all">r/unixporn</a> so I went the route
of insane ricing and configuration of obscure command line tools just
to look cool.  I was using <a href="https://github.com/San7o/nixos-dotfiles">NixOS</a>, of course, with all the trendy
software like kitty and other stupid crap.
</p>

<p>
I got frustrated with NixOS since It felt like a jail, so I removed
everything and I setup the most minimal system I could work on. During
this period I was getting passionate about kernel development, I
wrote a few kernel modules and I started writing my own operating
system. I was using my self compiled <a href="linux-from-scratch.html">linux from scratch</a>, for many
months I did not have a graphics sessions or a browser on my only
computer.
</p>

<p>
I started following the linux kernel development mailing lists and
many others. Pushing in this direction led me to an internship about
writing eBPF programs for a <a href="../kubernetes/kubernetes.html">kubernetes</a> cluster which got me into cloud
computing.
