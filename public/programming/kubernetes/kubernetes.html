<p>
I started playing with kubernetes just out of curosity, creating
some clusters locally. I then had the opportunity to work on tracing
kernel functions with eBPF programs in a kubernetes cluster so I
started looking deeper into kubernetes by writing an operator.
</p>

<p>
The main issue I have with kubernetes is that everything uses go,
and I don't like go. The language makes some opinable decisions
and really bad ones. For examples, there are no enums, no macros,
there is an init function but not a destroy one, no RAII, no
templates.. I could go on for a while, It feels like It is going
backwards.
