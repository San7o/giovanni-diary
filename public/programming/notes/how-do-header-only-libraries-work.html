<h2 id="orgf0c1513">How do header only libraries work?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf0c1513">
<p>
C code is commonly split over two types of files: .h headers
containing declarations, and .c files for their definitions. Usually,
.c files include header files in their translation unit; one header
may be imported in multiple .c files for sharing common declarations
such as structs, typedefs and functions. The separation of the two
files is necessary because the presence of multiple definitions for
the same declaration with external linkage is not allowed (in C++,
this is referred to as the One Definition Rule or ODR), hence they
should only appear in a single translation unit (the .c file).
</p>

<p>
C11 - 6.9 External definitions:
</p>

<pre class="example">
&gt; There shall be no more than one external definition for each
&gt; identifier declared with internal linkage in a translation
&gt; unit. Moreover, if an identifier declared with internal linkage is
&gt; used in an expression (other than as a part of the operand of a
&gt; sizeof or _Alignof operator whose result is an integer constant),
&gt; there shall be exactly one external definition for the identifier in
&gt; the translation unit
</pre>

<p>
Note that this only applies to external definitions. For `static`
storage class there may be multiple definitions of the same symbol in
multiple translation units.
</p>

<p>
Header-only libraries break the convention of .c and .h files by
providing both declarations and definitions in a single file, usually
an header since it is supposed to be included elsewhere. To make this
possible without providing the same definition more than once, all
user-facing definitions are guarded by an IMPLEMENTATION symbol
defined at compile time in a single translation unit.
</p>

<p>
The structure of a header-only library looks like the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-C"><span style="color: #ff7f24;">// </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">License: MIT
</span>
<span style="color: #b0c4de;">#if</span><span style="color: #b0c4de;">n</span><span style="color: #b0c4de;">def</span> MY_LIBRARY
<span style="color: #b0c4de;">#define</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">MY_LIBRARY</span>

<span style="color: #ff7f24;">// </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Declarations
</span>
<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">my_library_sum</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">a</span>, <span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">b</span>);

<span style="color: #b0c4de;">#ifdef</span> MY_LIBRARY_IMPLEMENTATION

<span style="color: #ff7f24;">// </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">Definitions
</span>
<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">my_library_sum</span>(<span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">a</span>, <span style="color: #98fb98;">int</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">b</span>)
{
  <span style="color: #00ffff;">return</span> a + b;
}

<span style="color: #b0c4de;">#endif</span> <span style="color: #ff7f24;">// </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">MY_LIBRARY_IMPLEMENTATION
</span>
<span style="color: #b0c4de;">#endif</span> <span style="color: #ff7f24;">// </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">MY_LIBRARY</span>
</pre>

For a full template project you can check out micro-example.h:
<a href="https://github.com/San7o/micro-example.h">https://github.com/San7o/micro-example.h</a>
</p>

<p>
Practically, if you define the IMPLEMENTATION in a single translation
unit, all the definitions will be included and compiled in that
translation unit. Hence, they will be available for linkage by the
other translation units (assuming the symbols were defined
externally).
</p>

<p>
The main advantage of this style of writing libraries is the
convenience of using an entire library just by including a single
file. That file can be easily managed in your version control system
like git, and often contains all the documentation you need to use
it. Quick, nice and simple.
</p>

<p>
Obviously this type of headers make sense for libraries that are
limited in size and provide only a few functionalities, not for
writing an operating system.

<h3 id="orgc280c20">A note on inlining</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc280c20">
<p>
For performance reasons, you may want the compiler to inline certain
functions. By inlining a function, you remove all the function calling
setup needed by your system, like copying the arguments to the stack
and saving some registers. In C, the function specifier `inline` hints
the compiler to do so.
</p>

<p>
C11 Draft - 6.7.4 Function specifiers:
</p>

<pre class="example">
&gt; A function declared with an inline function specifier is an inline
&gt; function. Making a function an inline function suggests that calls
&gt; to the function be as fast as possible. The extent to which such
&gt; suggestions are effective is implementation-defined.
&gt;
&gt; Any function with internal linkage can be an inline function. For a
&gt; function with external linkage, the following restrictions apply: If
&gt; a function is declared with an inline function specifier, then it
&gt; shall also be defined in the same translation unit. [...] An inline
&gt; definition does not provide an external definition for the function,
&gt; and does not forbid an external definition in another translation
&gt; unit. An inline definition provides an alternative to an external
&gt; definition, which a translator may use to implement any call to the
&gt; function in the same translation unit. It is unspecified whether a
&gt; call to the function uses the inline definition or the external
&gt; definition.
</pre>


<p>
When it comes to inlining, your options are the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>you can use just the `inline` specifier and provide the definition
in the same translation unit, but you also need to provide an
external symbol.</li>
<li>You can use `extern inline` to also export the symbol, but then
the compiler will not be able to inline it in other translation
units because he does not know the definition.</li>
<li>Lastly, you can use `static inline` to both define a symbol that
is valid only in this translation unit (so we don't have problems
with multiple definitions) and that can be inlined since you also
need to provide the definition. Although compilation time and link
time will be slower, since multiple copies of the same function
will be compiled.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This last option is the best one for inlining. If you want to allow
the compiler to inline the functions, you need to both define the
IMPLEMENTATION in every .c file, and set the storage class to static
inline. This usually can be done by defining a known value specified
in the header that will be placed before any declaration and
definition, for example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-C"><span style="color: #b0c4de;">#define</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">MICRO_TEST_DEF</span> <span style="color: #00ffff;">static</span> <span style="color: #00ffff;">inline</span>
</pre>
</div>

<h3 id="orgc9f6236">About the micro-headers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc9f6236">
<p>
I spent a lot of my free time writing the micro-headers recently and
going deep into this "subgenre" of programming, you can find my code
here for some examples:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/San7o/micro-headers/tree/main">https://github.com/San7o/micro-headers/tree/main</a>
</p>

<p>
The micro headers are a very useful collection of header-only
libraries. I use them for my own projects and needs, but I believe
they can be useful to other programmer's too.
</p>

<p>
The choice of C99 is more stylistic / preferential than a technical
one. I deeply enjoy C for its simplicity, stability and the comfort
that I feel when programming and having everything under my
control. Very few languages are able to achieve all of the above.
</p>

<p>
As a last note, and as my honest opinion, these header-only libraries
are really cool and incredibly easy to use. I have had a lot of fun
writing my own and learning a lot. Hopefully I made you want to write
code some more.
