I have somehow grown attached to this book. It set in front of me as a
base for my monitor for many years, so I am used to having it
around. Maybe I just want some UNIX influence every day.

<p>
Even if I understood nothing after reading the book when I was
in high school, it was the first technical book I have ever read
and it introduced me to UNIX.
</p>

<p>
If you want to learn about operating systems, I would rather suggest
the latest edition of "Modern Operating Systems" by Andrew Tanenbaum.
It introduces well all the concepts of operating systems and it is
a great read full of jokes.
</p>

<p>
Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment (APUE) does not focus so
much on how to make operating systems, instead it explains how UNIX
systems work following the POSIX standards: how do permission works,
how about file descriptors or processes, how singnals work in POSIX,
etc.
</p>

<p>
The book is a great reference for UNIX systems, with many examples,
exercises and historical clarifications. For a more diluted version I
would suggest "The Unix Programming Environment Book" by Brian
Kernighan, which focuses on the user interface with the system. APUE
goes a level deeper and explains how it all works under the hood.
</p>

<p>
The topics discussed are the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>UNIX standardization</li>
<li>file I/O</li>
<li>files and directories</li>
<li>standard I/O library</li>
<li>system files</li>
<li>process environment</li>
<li>process control (fork, etc&#x2026;)</li>
<li>process relationships (groups, logins&#x2026;)</li>
<li>signals</li>
<li>threads</li>
<li>thread control</li>
<li>daemon processes</li>
<li>advanced I/O</li>
<li>interprocess communication</li>
<li>network sockets</li>
<li>advanced IPC</li>
<li>terminal I/O</li>
<li>pseudo terminal</li>
</ul>

<p>
The book ends with a sample of a printer driver in 48 pages
(literally, there are 48 pages of code).
</p>

<p>
I will read it again when I will implement my own UNIX operating
system.
