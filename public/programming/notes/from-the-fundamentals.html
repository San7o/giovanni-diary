I think the best - and really only - way to become a good programmer
is to implement hard things yourself, from scratch. Yes, I know it
requires a huge effort, but that is exactly the point! And I think
this holds in general for most skills.
</p>

<p>
If I were to redesign the education system, I would start with this in
mind - at least that is what works best for me - and I would focus
on core technologies used by programmers, which include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>operating systems</li>
<li>compilers</li>
<li>databases</li>
<li>graphics renderers</li>
</ul>

<p>
After a full study program, the student should be able to implement a
non-naive version of all of the above. This is also what I will mostly
focus on in my free time from now on. Additionally - mostly to make
things more challenging - don't like to use external tooling for
similar reasons, like LLMs or language servers (syntax highlighting is
fine tho).
</p>

<p>
In my opinion, after having a good understanding of all of the above
(which is implied if the student managed to implement them), they
would be able to implement basically anything on their own.
</p>

<p>
Why do I feel like making this post? I will give an example: during my
bachelor in Computer Science in my university, I only had one class on
databases (the only one) and it was mostly about writing SQL queries
and a bit of the rationale behind their evaluation - far off from the
knowledge necessary to implement even a simple database. I had a
similar experience with all the above. For programming languages, I
had a class about regexes and a bit of parsing, things very important
but lacking in conclusion. For operating systems, we had a basic
overview of the most important subsystems like filesystems or
IPC. There were no classes on computer graphics. Furthermore, I
basically did no practice in any of these courses. You got my point.
</p>

<p>
After some time, I felt like I didn't know how to program anything, so
I started on my own. Maybe the reader can relate, or maybe not.
