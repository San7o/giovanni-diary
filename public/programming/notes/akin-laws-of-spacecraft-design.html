<h2 id="orgd524540">Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd524540">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only
an opinion.</li>
<li>To design a spacecraft right takes an infinite amount of
effort. This is why it's a good idea to design them to operate when
some things are wrong .</li>
<li>Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations
is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true
at any point in time.</li>
<li>Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless in
the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment.</li>
<li>(Miller's Law) Three points determine a curve.</li>
<li>(Mar's Law) Everything is linear if plotted log-log with a fat
magic marker.</li>
<li>At the start of any design effort, the person who most wants to be
team leader is least likely to be capable of it.</li>
<li>In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle
somewhere. Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme
point.</li>
<li>Not having all the information you need is never a satisfactory
excuse for not starting the analysis.</li>
<li>When in doubt, estimate. In an emergency, guess. But be sure to go
back and clean up the mess when the real numbers come along.</li>
<li>Sometimes, the fastest way to get to the end is to throw
everything out and start over.</li>
<li>There is never a single right solution. There are always multiple
wrong ones, though.</li>
<li>Design is based on requirements. There's no justification for
designing something one bit "better" than the requirements
dictate.</li>
<li>(Edison's Law) "Better" is the enemy of "good".</li>
<li>(Shea's Law) The ability to improve a design occurs primarily at
the interfaces. This is also the prime location for screwing it
up.</li>
<li>The previous people who did a similar analysis did not have a
direct pipeline to the wisdom of the ages. There is therefore no
reason to believe their analysis over yours. There is especially
no reason to present their analysis as yours.</li>
<li>The fact that an analysis appears in print has no relationship to
the likelihood of its being correct.</li>
<li>Past experience is excellent for providing a reality check. Too
much reality can doom an otherwise worthwhile design, though.</li>
<li>The odds are greatly against you being immensely smarter than
everyone else in the field. If your analysis says your terminal
velocity is twice the speed of light, you may have invented warp
drive, but the chances are a lot better that you've screwed up.</li>
<li>A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good
design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.</li>
<li>(Larrabee's Law) Half of everything you hear in a classroom is
crap. Education is figuring out which half is which.</li>
<li>When in doubt, document. (Documentation requirements will reach a
maximum shortly after the termination of a program.)</li>
<li>The schedule you develop will seem like a complete work of fiction
up until the time your customer fires you for not meeting it.</li>
<li>It's called a "Work Breakdown Structure" because the Work
remaining will grow until you have a Breakdown, unless you enforce
some Structure on it.</li>
<li>(Bowden's Law) Following a testing failure, it's always possible
to refine the analysis to show that you really had negative
margins all along.</li>
<li>(Montemerlo's Law) Don't do nuthin' dumb.</li>
<li>(Varsi's Law) Schedules only move in one direction.</li>
<li>(Ranger's Law) There ain't no such thing as a free launch.</li>
<li>(von Tiesenhausen's Law of Program Management) To get an accurate
estimate of final program requirements, multiply the initial time
estimates by pi, and slide the decimal point on the cost estimates
one place to the right.</li>
<li>(von Tiesenhausen's Law of Engineering Design) If you want to have
a maximum effect on the design of a new engineering system, learn
to draw. Engineers always wind up designing the vehicle to look
like the initial artist's concept.</li>
<li>(Mo's Law of Evolutionary Development) You can't get to the moon
by climbing successively taller trees.</li>
<li>(Atkin's Law of Demonstrations) When the hardware is working
perfectly, the really important visitors don't show up.</li>
<li>(Patton's Law of Program Planning) A good plan violently executed
now is better than a perfect plan next week.</li>
<li>(Roosevelt's Law of Task Planning) Do what you can, where you are,
with what you have.</li>
<li>(de Saint-Exupery's Law of Design) A designer knows that he has
achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but
when there is nothing left to take away.</li>
<li>Any run-of-the-mill engineer can design something which is
elegant. A good engineer designs systems to be efficient. A great
engineer designs them to be effective.</li>
<li>(Henshaw's Law) One key to success in a mission is establishing
clear lines of blame.</li>
<li>Capabilities drive requirements, regardless of what the systems
engineering textbooks say.</li>
<li>The three keys to keeping a new manned space program affordable
and on schedule:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No new launch vehicles.</li>
<li>No new launch vehicles.</li>
<li>Whatever you do, don't decide to develop any new launch vehicles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Space is a completely unforgiving environment. If you screw up the
engineering, somebody dies (and there's no partial credit because
most of the analysis was right&#x2026;)</li>
