<h2 id="org96bd314">Setting up an IRC client</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org96bd314">
<p>
I have been playing with IRC lately. In this note I will explain how
to setup your client to connect to an IRC server just in case I need
to do it again, nothing difficult or impressive really.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org12ec545" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org12ec545">Bouncer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org12ec545">
<p>
You want to have a bouncer running on your network, this is needed
because when you close any IRC client you will loose all the messages.
What a bouncer does is connecting to any IRC server for you, then you
will connect to the bouncer instead of connecting directly to the IRC
server. As long as the bouncer is live somewhere in your network, you
won't loose messages and you can connect via different client and
devices to the same bouncer.
</p>

<p>
You can use <a href="https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC">ZNC</a> as a bouncer, it is already packaged in many
distributions. On fedora, it is as easy as running:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo dnf install znc
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Fedora will also setup the systemd daemon that you can enable if
you want. In order to setup the bouncer, run:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">znc --makeconf
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This will prompt you a few settings. I will configure so that it will
connect to libera and disable ssl because it gave me problems.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nil">$ znc --makeconf

</div>

<p>
You can finally run ZNC by running the command <code>znc</code>, <code>znc --debug</code>
or via the systemd daemon. Check that you do not have firewall
rules that may block binds to the port.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, you can accesses an admin panel via http, as the
output of makeconf suggested.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nil">https://&lt;znc_server_ip&gt;:1025/
</pre>
</div>

<h3 id="org08a8257">Clients</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org08a8257">
<p>
There are as many IRC clients as you want. Now I use <a href="https://weechat.org/">weechat</a> which is
tui based, it is probably already packaged by your distribution.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">sudo dnf install weechat
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once you run weechat, you can connect to your server by first
adding a server and connecting to it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nil">/server add local localhost/1025
/connect local -username=santo_ -password=my-password
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You should see a buffer opening with a welcome message. If this is not
the case, something went wrong. If you get the message "this nickname
is registered. Please choose a different nickanme" you either are
already registered with that nickname and you should login with <code>/mng
NickServ IDENTIFY username password</code>, or someone already registered
that nickname and you need to change it. In this case, you can
directly edit the ZNC config file in <code>~/.znc/configs/znc.conf</code> and
restart the server with a different nickname.
</p>

<p>
To join a channel use the <code>join</code> command:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nil">/join #&lt;channel-name&gt;
</pre>
</div>


<p>
A useful command in weechat is to enable mouse support:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nil">/mouse enable
</pre>
</div>
