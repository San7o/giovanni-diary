One of the things I am more grateful for to university is getting me
introduced to the ideas of Mathematics. During high school, I had math
as one of the primary subjects, we went through the basics of algebra
and calculus up until integrals. In university the pace changed, and I
notices I was not used to <b>thinking</b> about math.
</p>

<p>
Up until my last year of bachelor, math was all about a lot of
exercises, memorizing formulas and "pattern match" problems. This was
how I was taught for my entire life and It took me a great effort and
time to leave this mentality.
</p>

<p>
At my last year I finally began developing a kind of maturity for math
and only then I really started enjoying It. It surely requires a lot
of thinking and intellectual effort but I find It rewarding, here I
will document my journey in the realm of mathematics.
