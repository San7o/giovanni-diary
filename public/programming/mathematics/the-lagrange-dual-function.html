In this post we will delve into the realm of optimization and in
particular we will look at the Lagrange dual function. I will be
using the book "Convex Optimization" by Stephen Boyd and Lieven

<h3 id="org8713f6d">Optimization problems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8713f6d">
<p>
A mathematical optimization problem, or just optimization problem, has
the form:
</p>

<p>
\[minimize\ f_0(x)\]
</p>

<p>
subject to:
</p>

<p>
\[f_i(x)\le b_i,\ i=1, ..., m\]
\[h_i(x) = 0,\ i=1, ..., p\]
</p>

<p>
Here the vector \(x=(x_1, ..., x_n)\) is the optimization variable of
the problem, the function \(f_0: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)
is the objective function, the functions \(f_i, h_i: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow
\mathbb{R},\ i=1, ..., m\) are the constraint functions, and the
constants \(b_i, ..., b_m\) are the limits, or bounds, of the
constraints. A vector \(x*\) is called optimal, or a solution of the
problem, if It has the smallest objective value among all vectors that
satisfy the constraints.
</p>

<p>
The optimal value \(x*\) of the above problem, also referred to as \(p*\),
is defined as:
</p>

<p>
\[x* = inf\{ f_0(x) | f_i(x) \le 0,\ i=1, ..., m,\ h_i(x)=0,\ i=1,
..., p \}\]
</p>

<p>
The optimal value for a maximization problem would be the greater
value instead.
</p>

<p>
The types of optimization problems can be divided into:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>linear programming</b> where the objective and all constraint
functions are linear meaning they satisfy the equality \(f_i(\alpha
  x+ \beta y) = \alpha f(x) + \beta f(y)\) for all \(x, y \in
  \mathbb{R}^n\) and all \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}\). There is no
simple analytical formula for the solution of a linear program, but
there are a variety of very effective methods including Dantzig's
simplex method and interior-point methods.</li>

<li><b>convex optimization</b> where the objective and constraint functions
are convex meaning they satisfy the equation \(f_i(\alpha x+ \beta y)
  \le \alpha f(x) + \beta f(y)\) for all \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n\) and
all \(\alpha , \beta \in \mathbb{R},\ \alpha + \beta = 1, \alpha \ge
  0, \beta \ge 0\). We say a function \(f\) is <b>concave</b> if \(-f\) is
convex. If just the objective function is convex but not the
constraints, the problem is called <b>quasiconvex</b>. Similar to linear
programming, in general there is no analytical formula for solving
these problems, but there are effective methods to do so like
interior-point methods. Fortunately, those are quite efficient for
computers and we are able to solve them quickly.</li>

<li><b>non linear optimization</b> for problems with non linear objective or
constraints which further divides into <b>local</b> optimization (finding
a local best solution) or <b>global</b> optimization which is usually
slower in terms of computation time. There is no general efficient
solution.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org67e0bb5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org67e0bb5">The Lagrangian</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org67e0bb5">
<p>
Consider a minimization problem as defined above, we assume the domain
\(D=\prod_{i=1}^m dom(f_i) \cap \prod_{i=1}^p dom(h_i)\) is non empty
and denote the optimal value by \(p*\).
</p>

<p>
The idea is to account for the constraints by augmenting the objective
function with a weighted sum of the constraints. We define the
<b>Lagrangian</b> \(L:\ \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^p
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) as:
</p>

<p>
\[L(x, \lambda, \nu) = f_0(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i f_i(x) +
\sum_{i=1}^p \nu_i h_i(x)\]
</p>

<p>
We refer to \(\lambda_i\) as the <b>Lagrange multiplier</b> associated with the
i-th inequality constraint \(f_i\le 0\) and \(\nu_i\) as the Lagrange
multiplier associated with the i-th equality constraint \(h_i(x)=0\). The
vectors \(\lambda\) and \(\nu\) are called the dual variables or Lagrange
multiplier vectors associated with the problem.
</p>

<p>
We define the <b>Lagrange dual function</b> \(g: \mathbb{R}^m \times
\mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) as the minimum value of the
Lagrangian over \(x\) associated to the previous problem: for \(\lambda
\in \mathbb{R}^n,\ \nu \in \mathbb{R}^p\),
</p>

<p>
\[g(\lambda , \nu) = inf_{x\in D} L(x, \lambda , \nu ) = inf_{x\in
D}(f_0(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i f_i(x) + \sum_{i=1}^p \nu_i
h_i(x))\]
</p>

<p>
It is easy to see that \(g(\lambda , \nu)\) is the lower bound of the
optimal value \(p*\), in fact the sum of \(f_i(x)\) is negative and the
sum of \(h_i(x)\) is zero for valid solutions, hence we are subtracting
from \(f_0(x)\) and we are looking for the vectors \(\lambda\) and \(\nu\)
that give the smaller valid value (or the greater subtraction), which
is the lower bound.
</p>

<h3 id="orge740a28">The dual problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge740a28">
<p>
We showed that \(g(\lambda , \nu)\) is the lower bound of the optimal
value \(p*\). But to find the optimal value we need to find the highest
lower bound. Hence, we need to maximize the dual function, meaning we need
to solve the problem:
</p>

<p>
\[maximize g(\lambda , \nu)\]
</p>

<p>
subject to:
</p>

<p>
\[\lambda \ge 0\]
</p>

<p>
This problem is called the Lagrange dual problem associated with the
original minimization problem. We refer to \((\lambda *, \nu *)\) as
dual optimal or optimal Lagrange multipliers if they are optimal for
the problem.
</p>

<p>
The Lagrange dual problem is a <b>convex optimization problem</b>, since
the objective to be maximized is concave (because "the dual function
is the point-wise infium of a family of affine functions", gl) and the
constraint is convex (indeed the constraint \(f(x) < \lambda_i\) has
function \(f(x)=0\) which satisfies the definition of convex).  This is
always the case whether or not the original problem (sometimes referred
to as primal problem) is convex.

<p>
Let's now consider convex optimization problems. A fundamental
property of convex optimization problems is that any locally optimal
point is also globally optimal, this can be proven my contradiction.
</p>

<p>
The convex optimization problem is called a quadratic program if the
objective function is convex and quadratic, and the constraint
functions are affine (linear). A quadratic program can be expressed in
the form:
</p>

<p>
\[minimize\ \frac{1}{2}x^TPx + q^Tx+r\]
</p>

<p>
subject to:
</p>

<p>
\[Gx \le h\]
\[Ax=b\]
</p>

<p>
where \(P\) is a symmetric positive matrix where \(x^TPx\) is always
positive.
</p>

<p>
There are many techniques to solve these kind of problems. If the
problem is unconstrained, you can use backtracking (move in steps and
reduce the step size incrementally), <a href="../notes/ml/06-gradient-descent.html">gradient descent</a>, steepest
descent or newton's method. If It is also very simple, you can
calculate the first and second derivatives and equal them to 0. In
equality constrained problems you can use more sophisticated versions
of the Newton step or using barriers.  In general, you can use the
interior-point method.
</p>

<p>
Explaining those falls outside of the scope of this blog, you can
dig deeper if you want. I think gradient descent is the easier to
understand and you can find my notes <a href="../notes/ml/06-gradient-descent.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
What we talked about here is used in practice in various areas, such
as <a href="../notes/ml/07-support-vector-machines.html">machine learning</a>.
