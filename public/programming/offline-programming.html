I often practice offline programming and It is something I want to
share with other people. Offline programming means what it means, to
go totally offline while doing that I like: programming. Of course
this is not limited to programming: It can be reading, writing,
debugging, etc.
</p>

<p>
But Giovanni, just disconnect from the internet and that is It, you
may say, and I would totally agree with you. Except the fact that we
have become so reliant on the internet that this is not so
straightforward. I grew up assuming I could find help in online forums
whenever I needed it. New generations will grow up assuming they can
use LLMs to answer all their questions (which can be good and bad, I
will leave this discussion for another day). But when you are offline,
you are on your own.  It's just me, the computer / compiler and the
program I am writing, and I LIKE this.
</p>

<p>
How do I use a certain API? how do I learn it? I may keep doing what
I know but at a certain point I will need to do something I don't
know, how can I learn new information?
</p>

<p>
I think being able to autonomously figure out all of this is a great
skill to have. Moreover, when I program offline I have less
distractions.  Since I don't need an internet connection, I can be
wherever I want as long as my battery lasts (so I am optimizing for
power consumption in my kernel configuration). I may start looking at
the sky or at the trees around me instead of a youtube video when I
need a break. I may start paying attention to the sound of the birds
or the movement of the clouds, or deeply reason about the problem
I have, since there is no other way around.
</p>

<p>
Back to the question, how do you learn more stuff. Unsurprisingly,
people have been collecting many forms of knowledge throuought
history, even before the internet. In software, this can be
documentation or actual source code. Of course, some programs are
more documented than others, with the best example probably being
emacs which has a huge offline documentation pre-installed in each
emacs build, and each package is easily explorable. I will prefer
simple, free and open source software over any other, so that I can
unserstand it and modify It as I need / want. I will use something
like Linux From Scratch instead of depending on an already existing
linux distribution to do package management for me. Anyway, getting
used to reading source code is probably the best thing you can learn.
</p>

<p>
But you already knew all of this, the question becomes how do I
learn something that is not related to programming. People back
in the day created what is referred to as an encyclopedia, a collection
of basically everything. The modern version would be wikipedia,
which you can download locally. I find this very helpful, expecially
for math and history.
</p>

<p>
To do offline work you will need software that works offline. Instead
of google docs, you can use libre office or emacs. You can download
music locally and use a local music player, or emacs. You can download
book and films and store them forever in your hard drive.
</p>

<p>
When I am offline I feel like I am in total control of my computer,
everything is compiled from source and my system is stable. Further,
I don't need to worry about cybersecurity anymore.
</p>

<p>
The point of this page is that I like praciting being completely
offline for long periods of time, while still doing what I consider
productive tasks as a programmer. Of course, your work may require
and internet connection, but you can choose how to spend your own
free time afterwards and I decided to spend it offline.
