I volunteered on various associations for several years. This was part
of my identity, I believed in the value of volunteering and in the
associations I was participating with. Coincidentally, Trento was
selected as the European Capital of Volunteering for 2024 so there was
a lot of movement in this area.
</p>

<p>
I joined <a href="https://www.caritas.org/">caritas</a> in my home town, I was preparing dishes for the poor.
In Trento I joined <a href="https://www.sat.tn.it/">SAT</a> where I was organizing Hikes with groups of
kids, sometimes I did trail maintenance. I then joined <a href="https://fondoambiente.it/">FAI</a> for some
time to promote history. I guess contributing on <a href="../programming/notes/contributing-to-openstreetmap.html">openstreetmap</a> is
considered volunteering.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately I had to stop to focus on my career, but once I will
be more setup I am looking forward to do volunteering again.
