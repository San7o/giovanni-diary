Throughout my life I have had several youtube channels where I
uploaded various types of videos.
</p>

<p>
My first channel was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@San7oS">San7oS</a> and was mostly minecraft videos. I
published videos for about 3 years without ever a break, I had a lot
of fun but after a while I got bored. Some time later I began playing
osu! and I uploaded some osu clips on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@san7ososu404">San7oS Osu!</a>.
</p>

<p>
As I began playing games less and less I started concentrating on
other things. I opened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@giovannisantini6094">Giovanni Santini</a> as a creative outlet where I
posted some piano plays. In university I opened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@giovannis-diary">Giovanni's Diary</a>
mostly focused on coding, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Giogames-d6f">Giogames</a> where I post clip of <a href="videogames/videogames.html">videogames</a>
I play, even though I don't play in recent years.
