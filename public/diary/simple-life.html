I was taking a wolk in my neighbourhood, there is not much too see
here. A couple of small parks, some triees, and mostly residential
houses. Yesterday I was watching a live of Prod. in real time, he was
just answering some questions from chat. He is such an interesting
and unique person, let me elaborate. Some people know him for his
philosophy videos, I belive he has a formal education in philosophy
and he often records his walks where he openly shared hit thoughts.
He lives a simple life in the mountain, with little to no human
contact or even electricity. Some other people know him for his
emacs videos: he is a maintainer of some well-known pacakges and he is
surely very knowledgable about the emacs-craft. He brings this two
worlds togheter, that is why I think he is so unique.
I started to watch his emacs videos and became interested into the
philosophy ones. What strikes me is his self aweareness. Just by
talking, he uncovered some of my own inner hazards and helped me
get more aware of them.
What I always do is to hide or suppress my emotional being, in order
to live a more emotionless-life, a life where I can act objectively
and with caution. I needed this because emotionally I am a very
introverted, shy and insecure person. I always mind my own business
and hardly interact with other people. However, If I rationalize my
actions, I may come to the conclusion that talking to someone or
starting a new activity is in my best interest, so I keep moving like
this. The more I think of myself like this, the more my emotional-self
hides and slowly dies. What I am realizing is that <code>emotions are part
of one's self</code> and are essential to one's well being, what a
breaking-news!
The reasons why I hide are a bit more complicated that what I
mentioned previously. Other than my insecurity, I have lived a past
relationship with another person that I still cannot get over.
I lived the relationship vividly, and I considered myself happy about
this; but then It suddently come to a close, maybe after a lack of
understanding of each other's emotions (I was still into her, but the
feeling was not both-ways) so It came to an end quite badly and I
am still recovering. One year and an half has passed but I still
think about here, I cannot think about anyone else this way, but
there is little to no-interest on the other side. I keep asking her
how is she about every month, but I feel like I am the only one
interested in the converstaion. Why am I still not over with this?
I don't know, this is what my mind is doing, despite how much I try
to suppress It, the feelings do not go away so quickly. When I have
feelings, I feel them very stringly, I consider myself a very
emotional person, that is why I try do suppress It as much as
possible, because feelings are too strong. I want to try to allow
myself this feelings, see If I get better.

Another point of reflection of this walk was history and searching
through old stuff. In the park where I usually go there is a small
wooden shelf under some stone structute. It is one of those shelfes
where people may take or leave any book. I always stop there to see
new books and If something interests me I would take It home for
some time. Some of the books are narrative, some of them are
didactical books, most of them are very old. What fascinates me is how
those pieces of paper can open a window into the past and look at
the world from a totally different prospective. For example, there
was a local newspaper from a lot of time ago, It was one of the
first with colored ink. It looked like from another era, totally
another style. I imagined how people reading this newspaper looked
like and I find It peaceful. I always imagine a simpler life, a lower
life, and I enjoy those thoughts.

I am now letting my imagination fly and thinking about how my
sourroundings looked like. I want to know the history of those places,
if fills my mind. What I may do one day is to go to some little town
and write some stories on what could have happened. Even better, I
want to find historical books about those location, to trurly immerse
myself in those times. One last think could be to describe some of
the locations nowdays, so that people may know how life was here right
now. I am not gonna lie, I am pretty excited about this.

Anyway, I am heading back home right now. I updated my todo list with
some stuff.
