<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5b40085">
<p>
I have always been fascinated by the idea of documenting my life. I
get to save some moments and thoughts to reflect upon later, It
helps me to have a better sense of myself and my direction. In some
way It is a proof of my existence, a side effect of my being.
</p>

<p>
The way I have been documenting my time is always changing, this diary
is just the latest of my iterations. Yet, It creates something I will
look back to with a sense of nostalgia. After all, history has started
when we humans began to document it, most of what came before is now
lost and I think it is a shame.
</p>

<p>
I wish I had more data about what I did when I was little, or about my
first days of high school, or during my lowest moments. This keeps me
motivated to document what I am going through now, even when It seems
to be unimportant.
