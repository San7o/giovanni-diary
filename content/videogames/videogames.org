#+INDEX: Giovanni's Diary!Videogames

I was a *huge gamer* in the past. I spent all my teenage years playing
Dark Souls, The Witcher, Skyrim, Osu and some more. I used to follow
the industry very closely, I played a lot of indie games too.

One of my favorite publishers is *Annapurna*, they see videogames as
creative work, like art; I am talking about What Remains of Edith
Finch, Twelve Minutes, Florence, Journey and many more. Some other
really interesting games I liked are Return of the Obra Dinn, Gris and
Firewatch.
