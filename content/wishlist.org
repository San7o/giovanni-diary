* Wish list :global:

This document contains my wishlist for future projects that do not
belong to any of the other wishlists. Generally, each section of
this wiki has It's own wishlist which you cann access from the
home pages.

** TODO Setup rss feed for this blog
Finish writing tiny-rss.

** TODO Redesign the look of the website
Right now, the wesite is using very simple css stilying. While I
like simple things, I want to explore different looks while
remaining as minimalistic and readable as possible. I should
probably take inspiraton from themes in emacs that I like.
