* Wish list :global:

This document contains my wishlist for future projects that do not
belong to any of the other wishlists. Generally, each section of
this wiki has It's own wishlist which you cann access from the
home pages.

I use *org-agenda* to manage all the *TODO* items in the different
wishlist files. Just for completeness, here is a list of the other
wishlist files:

- [[file:reading/wishlist.org][reading wishlist]]
- [[file:programming/wishlist.org][programming wishlist]]
- [[file:programming/emacs/wishlist.org][emacs wishlist]]

** Content

*** TODO Add some sort of index
An index to quickly find pages should be created. As new pages
get more and more nested, such system would be really helpful
for naviagion. I was thinking to have a ingle big index of all
the pages starting from root with indentation.
