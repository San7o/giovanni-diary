* Wish list :global:

This document contains my wishlist for future projects that do not
belong to any of the other wishlists. Generally, each section of
this wiki has It's own wishlist which you cann access from the
home pages.

I use *org-agenda* to manage all the *TODO* items in the different
wishlist files. Just for completeness, here is a list of the other
wishlist files:

- [[file:reading/wishlist.org][reading wishlist]]
- [[file:programming/wishlist.org][programming wishlist]]
- [[file:programming/emacs/wishlist.org][emacs wishlist]]
