Hello and welcome to my humble [[file:my-public-diary.org][public diary]].

I am a computer science student and I enjoy talking about [[file:programming/programming.org][programming]]
and my [[file:reading/reading.org][readings]]. I also keep a daily diary called [[file:ephemeris/ephemeris.org][ephemeris]] and I write
about places in my [[file:reading/surroundings/surroundings.org][surroundings]] series, anything else that I do goes
in my [[file:stash/stash.org][stash]].

In this diary I [[file:documenting.org][document]] what I do and my thoughts about It. Note that
this website respects you by not collecting cookies and not using
javascript except for rendering latex in some pages. Have fun
[[file:secret1.org][exploring]]!

I really like receiving *emails*. If you want to have any kind of
conversation about anything with me, please, I encourage you to write
me at **[[mailto:giovanni.santini@proton.me][giovanni.santini@proton.me]]**.
