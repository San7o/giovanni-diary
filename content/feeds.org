* RSS Feed

RSS feeds are generated with my custom generator https://github.com/San7o/tiny-rss.
I consider this still experimental so expect lots of changes and random
feeds.

If you still want to subscribe, at your own risk, currently those are
the available feeds:
- file:feeds/feedSurroundings.rss: feed for the Surrounding series,
  described here file:reading/surroundings/surroundings.org
- file:feeds/feedEphemeris.rss: feed for my public diary described
  here file:ephemeris/ephemeris.org
