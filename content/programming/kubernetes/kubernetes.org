* Kubernetes
#+INDEX: Giovanni's Diary!Programming!Kubernetes

I started playing with kubernetes just out of curiosity, creating
some clusters locally. I then had the opportunity to work on tracing
kernel functions with eBPF programs in a kubernetes cluster so I
started looking deeper into kubernetes by writing an operator.

You can find my work on the operator [[https://github.com/San7o/hive-operator][here]].

I will do a second internship this summer, again on Kubernetes and
containerization technology.

If you want to learn kubernetes, check out some [[file:kubernetes-resources.org][resources]].
