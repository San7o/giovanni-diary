Here is code snippets extracted from my other projects that can be
easily reused, or implementation of simple algorithms, or just
knowledge that I should remember.

- [[file:c/set_signals.c.org][C/set_signals.c]]: Setup an handler for various POSIX signals.
- [[file:c/left_space.c.org][C/left_space.c]]: Get number of separator charactes from the left of a string in C99.
- [[file:c/mandelbrot.c.org][C/mandelbrot.c]]: Get the number of iterations of a point in the Mandelbrot set.
- [[file:c/sdl_window.c.org][C/sdl_window.c]]: Create an SDL3 window and poll events.
- [[file:c/clear_screen.c.org][C/clear_sceen.c]]: Clear the terminal screen using ANSI control sequences.
- [[file:c/delta_time.c.org][C/delta_time.c]]: Calculate the frame delta time and render a certain number of times per seconds in C99.
- [[file:c/unix_server.c.org][C/unix_server.c]]: Create an unix socket server that reads data sent to it.
- [[file:c/inet_server.c.org][C/inet_server.c]]: Create an inet server that reads data sent to it.
- [[file:c/lcg.c.org][C/lcg.c]]: LCG algorithm for fast speudo random number generation. Not cryptographically secure but good enough and really fast for other use cases.
- [[file:c/hash_djb2.c.org][C/hash_djb2.c]]: Simple hash function for strings.
- [[file:c/utils.h.org][C/utils.h]]: Utility macros for C projects.
- [[file:c/mmap_file.c.org][C/mmap_file.c]]: Read a file's contents using mmap. This is faster than read(2), and returns a pointer to the content of the file without needing to call read(2) each time.
- [[file:c/traverse_dir.c.org][C/traverse_dir.c]]: Traverse a directory recursively and call handle_file on each file.
- [[file:c/CMakeLists.txt.org][C/CMakeLists.txt]]: Modern Cmake template for C++ projects.
- [[file:c/Makefile.org][C/Makefile]]: Simple Makefile template for C projects.
- [[file:web/micro-style.css.org][web/micro-style.css]]: Very simple css style for minimalistic websites.
- [[file:config/init.lua.org][config/init.lua]]: Simple Neovim configuration without too much bloat.
- [[file:config/i3config.org][config/i3config]]: My configuration file for i3 window manager.
- [[file:scripts/win2usb.sh.org][scripts/win2usb.sh]]: Copy the windows installer to an USB pen from Linux.
- [[file:misc/hello_world.asm.org][misc/hello_world.asm]]:  Hello world x86-64 Linux assembly example.
