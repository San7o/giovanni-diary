#+INDEX: Giovanni's Diary!Programming!Notes!Setting up an IRC client

I have been playing with IRC lately. In this note I will explain how
to setup your client to connect to an IRC server just in case I need
to do It again, nothing difficult or impressive really.

** Bouncer

You want to have a bouncer running on your network, this is needed
because when you close any IRC client you will loose all the messages.
What a bouncer does is connecting to any IRC server for you, and you
will connect to the bouncer instead of connecting directly to the IRC
server. As long as the bouncer is live somewhere in your network, you
won't loose messages and you can connect via different client and
devices to the same bouncer.

You can use [[https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC][ZNC]] as a bouncer, It is already packaged in many
distributions. On fedora, It is as easy as running:

#+begin_src bash
  sudo dnf install znc
#+end_src

Fedora will also setup the systemd daemon that you can enable if
you want. In order to setup the bouncer, run:

#+begin_src bash
  znc --makeconf
#+end_src

This will promp you a few settings. I will connect to libera and
disable ssl because It gave me problems.

#+begin_src
$ znc --makeconf

[ .. ] Checking for list of available modules...

[ .. ] Writing config [/home/santo/.znc/configs/znc.conf]...
[ ** ]
[ ** ] To connect to this ZNC you need to connect to it as your IRC server
[ ** ] using the port that you supplied.  You have to supply your login info
[ ** ] as the IRC server password like this: user/network:pass.
[ ** ]
[ ** ] Try something like this in your IRC client...
[ ** ] /server <znc_server_ip> +1025 santo_:<pass>
[ ** ]
[ ** ] To manage settings, users and networks, point your web browser to
[ ** ] https://<znc_server_ip>:1025/
[ ** ]
[ ?? ] Launch ZNC now? (yes/no) [yes]: no
#+end_src

You can finally run ZNC by running the command =znc=, =znc --debug=
or via the systemd daemon. Check that you do not have firewall
rules that may block binds to the port.

Additionally, you can accesses an admin panel via http, as the
output of makeconf suggested.

#+begin_src
  https://<znc_server_ip>:1025/
#+end_src

** Clients

There are as many IRC clients as you want. I now use [[https://weechat.org/][weechat]] which is
tui based, It is usually already packaged by your distribution.

#+begin_src bash
  sudo dnf install weechat
#+end_src

Once you run weechat, you can connect to your server by first
adding a server and connecting to it:

#+begin_src
  /server add local localhost/1025
  /connect local -username=santo_ -password=my-password
#+end_src

You should see a buffer opening eith a welcome message. If this is not
the case, something went wrong. If you get the message "this nickname
is registered. Please choose a different nickanme" you either are
already registered with that nickname and you should login with =/mng
NickServ IDENTIFY username password=, or someone already registered
that nickname and you need to change it. In this case, you can
directly edit the ZNC config file in =~/.znc/configs/znc.conf= and
restart the server with a different nickname.

To join a channel use the =join= command:

#+begin_src
  /join #<channel-name>
#+end_src


A useful command in weechat is to enable mouse support:

#+begin_src
  /mouse enable
#+end_src
