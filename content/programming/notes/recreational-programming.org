#+INDEX: Giovanni's Diary!Programming!Notes!Recreational Programming

I would define "recreational programming" (or "recreational coding")
as the act of programming for the purpose of pure enjoyment rather
than a strictly application-based professional activity. It is the
idea that programming can be a gratifying and pleasant activity for
some nerds. A fellow recreational programmer finds enjoyment in
exploring their programming ideas just for the sake of exploring them,
often with little to no practical use, motivated simply by the idea
that they are "cool". It frequently happens that a recreational
programmer writes things that have never been done before or in new
ways (sometimes inventions of their own), thanks to their deep
understanding of computer systems, pushing the collective
understanding of what is possible. Any recreational programmer deeply
cares about their code and considers coding as a form of art, or an
expression of themselves.

The term "recreational programming" was popularized by the Russian
programmer "Tsoding" ([[https://github.com/tsoding][github]], [[https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding][twitch]], [[https://www.youtube.com/tsoding][youtube]]), who introduced many
young programmers to the art of coding for fun. His anti-corporate,
anti-trend style of programming, along with his great skill,
experience and charming personality made him well-known among nerds,
creating a strong community around him. Some of his notable projects
are: a [[https://github.com/bext-lang/b][compiler for the B programming language]] written in [[https://github.com/tsoding/Crust][crust]] (a
rust dialect where you can only use unsafe and unconventional
features), a [[https://github.com/tsoding/todo.asm][TODO web application]] written in x86-64 assembly, a [[https://github.com/tsoding/Murayact][react
renderer]] that uses [[https://www.raylib.com/][Raylib]] as the backend, and many many more.

The origin of the term is not clear. Aside from Tsoding, there are
[[https://www.tobiasfors.se/the-value-of-recreational-programming/][other mentions]] around the internet, but the oldest one I have found is
in Terry A. Davis's [[https://templeos.org/][TempleOS]]. Even his programming language, [[https://holyc-lang.com/][HolyC]], is
referred to as a language for recreational programming.

  TempleOS is a x86_64 [...] operating system for recreational programming.

with ring 3.  TempleOS is for
recreational programming, after all.

However, the idea of coding for fun has been around as long as
computer programming has existed, and many veteran programmers have
experienced at least once the joy that a recreational programmer lives
for. The great hackers at MIT in the 60s wrote things like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_Compiler][Harmony
Compiler]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!][Spacewar!]] on the PDP-1 for fun, things most people
could not even imagine. They thought about programming as the most
important thing in the world, in sharp contrast to the IBM people in
the same building, who were doing very boring and behind closed doors
business or military applications.

The recreational programmer and the hacker share values in many ways
and would get along well (on IRC). Yet, they have great differences
too. Hacker culture, born at MIT and spread worldwide, has developed a
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic][strong ethic]] based on ideas like "sharing, openness, decentralization
and free access to computers". Hackers believe that all information
should be free and often mistrust authority. The recreational
programmer does not care much about all that stuff.  These are good
and important things, but the recreational programmer just wants to
have fun and stay away from politics.

The ideas behind recreational programming are not unique to
programming either; for example, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_mathematics][recreational mathematics]] popularized
by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner][Martin Gardner]] has existed for much longer, as well as recreational
music composition like other forms of artistic expression. These
activities motivate people in their work, while improving their
skills.
