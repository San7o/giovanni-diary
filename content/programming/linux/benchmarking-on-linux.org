#+INDEX: Giovanni's Diary!Programming!Linux!Benchmarking on Linux

Running benchmarks is ultimately the best way to compare two different
systems or to assert that a particular modification has had any
positive or negative effect on the system's performance. To do
benchmarks I have been using the [[https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite][phoronix test suite]], in this document
I will briefly explain what phoronix is and how It works.

** Overview

Phoronix is the name of a famous [[https://www.phoronix.com/][website]] founded by Michael Larabel in
2004 where Michael has been publishing benchmarks and news of linux
applications for the most part. I personally think his website is one
of the most reliable sources of information regarding performance and
news on latest software and hardware. Michael has also create his
testing framework, the Phoronix Test Suite, which he uses for all his
benchmarks.

The Phoronix Test Suite is composed of an [[https://openbenchmarking.org/tests][immense number of benchmarks]]
supporting many operating systems including Linux, Windows, maxOS,
Solaris and various BSD. Around this tool there is a community of
people creating new tests and sharing results in the
[[https://openbenchmarking.org/results/latest][openbenchmarking.org]] website. Here, anybody can view and compare them
via the web interface. Furthermore, you can schedule and run your
custom test suites on multiple machines and visualize results in nice
graphs of various kinds.

** Command line usage

You can download the phoronix test suite from the official [[https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite][github]]
page, or through you favorite package manager. Fedora provides the
package "phoronix-test-suite-$VERSION". Running the command will give
you a bunch of possible flags you can enter.

#+begin_src bash
  phoronix-test-suite help
#+end_src

For the most basic usage, you may want to select and run a test. Let's
first list all the available tests:

#+begin_src bash
  phoronix-test-suite list-all-tests
#+end_src

Let's pick for example "pts/unpack-linux", a popular test to unpack the
linux kernel. To get more information about a single test, run:

#+begin_src bash
   phoronix-test-suite info pts/unpack-linux
#+end_src

Some tests may depend on some programs which you need to have
installed in your system, those programs are usually listed under the
"Software Dependencies" voice on the infos.

Let's try to run the test now. Note that the tests are lazily fetched
meaning that you don't have all the tests downloaded in you system but
you decide which one to download. When running a test it automatically
gets downloaded.

#+begin_src bash
  phoronix-test-suite test pts/unpack-linux
#+end_src

The program will ask if you want to save the results to a file, and to
give an unique name for the test. The test will start running, often
multiple times. After completion, you are asked if you want to view
the results on a web page, otherwise you will be able to do so from
the command line by starting the result viewer:

#+begin_src bash
   phoronix-test-suite start-result-viewer
#+end_src

From here you get a web page where you can explore the results,
compare them and export them in various formats such as pdf, html,
json etc..

** openbenchmarking.org

You can view other people's benchmarks and tests on
[[https://openbenchmarking.org/][openbenchmarking.org]]. It is particularly useful to download or compare
the results directly through the browser by writing a comma separated
list of the IDs of the benchmarks you want to compare on the url. It
is easier to see with an example, the request with the following url
will compare the results between the test "2505249-NE-RES42653018" and
"2505242-NE-RES51774018", where each ID was generated when uploading a
result to the website:

#+begin_src
  https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2505249-NE-RES42653018,2505242-NE-RES51774018
#+end_src

The website is also useful to look for specific tests and their
results over various systems averaged by all the tests from the
community. You can find this information in the [[https://openbenchmarking.org/tests][tests]] page.

** Phoromatic server

The coolest think about phoronix in my opinion is the
phoromatic-server. Using the same program we have been using to run
the tests, we can host a server using:

#+begin_src bash
  phoronix-test-suite start-phoromatic-server
#+end_src

This will start a web interface where you can remotely manage
benchmarks on multiple machines. When you first open the web page,
you can login or create an account (locally), then you will get an
overview page with the state of the various machines you have
connected and which benchmarks are running or are scheduled to run.

From the "systems" page you can manage your machines. You will get
a list of the connected machines with a description of their hardware
and software. The page contains instructions to connect other machines,
which looks like running a command similar to:

#+begin_src bash
  phoronix-test-suite phoromatic.connect 10.10.100.1:8484/VA9KRR
#+end_src

From the "test" page you can browse tests, and from the "testing"
page you can schedule them. You usually need to create a custom
test suite which is just a collection of one or more tests to run. You
can then run the suite and see the results in the "results" page.

Even if the user interface does not look pretty, phoronix is a really
powerful tool that does the job done. There are many more
functionalities and I think It is worth the time to learn and explore
what the tool is able to do.
