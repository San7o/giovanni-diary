** Gists

GitHub gists are short pieces of code, I use them for algorithms
or examples:

- [[https://gist.github.com/San7o/4bfe69a9e1eb251d5267d8b74ff73dda][knn.c]]: Implementation of KNN for supervised learning classification
  on a one-dimensional dataset in C.
- [[https://gist.github.com/San7o/da2efc84eb3e7c8bdbefbd540c8cfbea][perceptron.c]]: Implementation of a perceptron for binary
  classification in C.

There are many more which are not really interesting or are not public,
so I didn't mention them.
