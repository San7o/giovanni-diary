* Programming

Programming is my main occupation and *passion*. I am particularly
interested in *operating systems* (UNIX and friends). I am writing a
simple kernel on my own, something similar to the first Linux 1.0
release.

I have worked on many projects, mostly system level stuff. You can
find my code on my github profile https://github.com/San7o/ .
I am currently working on an *eBPF + kubernetes* application to log
file accesses in a file:./kubernetes/kubernetes.org cluster.

I do all my reading, writing and coding in file:emacs/emacs.org on
Linux (file:interjection.org), currently using Fedora but I am
a big linux from scratch user.
