* Programming

Programming is my main occupation and passion. I am particularly
interested in operating systems (UNIX and friends), I am writing a
simple kernel on my own, something similar to the first Linux 1.0
release.

I have worked on many projects, system level stuff mostly. You can
find my code on my github profile https://github.com/San7o/ .
I am currently working on an eBPF + kubernetes application to log
file accesses in a file:./kubernetes/kubernetes.org cluster.

I do all my reading, writing and coding in file:emacs/emacs.org.

Check out future projects I have in mind: file:wishlist.org
