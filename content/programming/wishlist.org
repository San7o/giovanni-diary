** Coding

*** TODO Simple filesystem inspired by ext2

Write a linux filesystem inspired by ext2, this should be really fun.

*** TODO Write a database

First, write an in memory database in C like redis as a warm up.
When you feel ready, write a proper database with permanent
storage.

*** TODO Write a container runtime

Write my own OCI compliant container runtime.

*** TODO Keep working on the operating system

I really want to work on my own operating system but it takes
a lot of time and I need to find it.
