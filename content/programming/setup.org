* Setup
#+INDEX: Giovanni's Diary!Programming!Setup

Here is my current setup. I noticed that It changes often and I will
try to keep this page updated.

My main laptop:

- Model:  HP 250 G8 Notebook PC
- Operating system: Linux 6.13.11
- Distribution: Fedora 41
- Window manager: [[https://github.com/San7o/dwm][dwm]]
- App launcher: dmenu
- Terminal Emulator: xterm
- Shell: sh
- Editor: [[file:emacs/emacs.org][emacs]]
- Browser: firefox

Additionally, I have a bunch of laptops with various BSDs and a
desktop with about the same setup of my main laptop, but I rarely use
them. A few years ago I had an impressive gaming setup but now I stay
mostly in libraries or university so I primarily use the laptop.

Two of my laptops have some screws sticking outside because the joint
broke:
