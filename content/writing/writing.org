* Writing
#+INDEX: Giovanni's Diary!Writing

I find writing very relaxing and it helps me clear my mind and focus.

To re-explore creative writing, I started a series called [[file:surroundings/surroundings.org][surroundings]]
where I talk about places. Sometimes I feel creative, sometimes I want
to learn about history, some other times I like to be a guide.

I save various thoughts in my [[file:reflections/reflections.org][reflections]].

Check out my [[file:../ephemeris/ephemeris.org][journal]] and [[file:../blog.org][blog posts]]. I also write some [[file:poetry/poetry.org][poems]].

You may be interested also in my [[file:../reading/reading.org][readings]].
