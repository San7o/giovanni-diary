* Ephemeris

Ephemeris (ἐφημερίς) is an ancient greek word meaning diary, journal.
In astronomy, ephemeris refers to a book of tables describing the
trajectory of astronomical objects.

I keep a daily diary since 2022 which I update quite regularly.
I used to write everything on paper, I then switched to Obsidian
for one year, then back to paper again and finally on Emacs org
mode. I still think that nothing beats a physical diary.

Here I will keep a sort of public diary with various thoughts and
stuff I find interesting for the record. To stay up to date with
