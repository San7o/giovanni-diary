I did so many things this week, I don't know where to start.

I switched my window manager from i3 to [[https://github.com/San7o/dwm][dwm]]. The cool thing about dwm
is that there is no configuration file, instead you have to change
the C cource code and recompile it. Moreover, dwm is very very
minimal and for most of the things you would need to write custom code,
such as full screen, startup programs and different tiling arrangements.
It is possible to customize it because it is very minimali, abour 2000
lines of code, which is amazing. I didn't read the entire source yet
but I will soon because It is very educational.

Another thing, I downloaded Wikipedia, at least some sections of it.
You can download wikipedia to read It offline, and I REALLY like this.
I am becoming more and more independent from the internet every day and
I am enjoying my offline sessions. I have written [[file:../programming/offline-programming.org][offline programming]]
where I talk about this, I used kiwis to download and view the
compressed wikipedia data.

I tried to get into space photography by downloading some images from
JWST and edited them. You can download the .fits file from the [[https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html][mast]]
portal, then you need to fix the colors with some stretch filters.
I used [[https://siril.org/][siril]] for this, which is very powerful but I would prefer
something simpler. I then exported the modified .fits into .tif and
added colors with gimp. The result is not that great but It's a start.

Yesterday there was the nintendo direct where they announced the
switch 2. I am not a really big fan of Nintendo, being a PC gamer
for my whole life, but the interesting news is that Silk Song exists
and FromSoftware will release a new game similar to bloodborne in style...
exclusive for the nintendo switch... (sight). Also two new chapters
of deltarune (which I never player but I want to since It is very short).

I have been writing machine learning algorithms, such as [[https://gist.github.com/San7o/4bfe69a9e1eb251d5267d8b74ff73dda][KNN]] and the
[[https://gist.github.com/San7o/da2efc84eb3e7c8bdbefbd540c8cfbea][perceptron]]. I am particularly enjoying the math behind everything.
