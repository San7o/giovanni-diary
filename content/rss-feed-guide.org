*** What is RSS and how does it work?

RSS is a standard format to let a client access updates from a
website. The standard is xml based, feeds files (usually ending with
.rss or .xml) have at least a title, a link and a description, and
zero or more feed items.  The way this works is that a server would
host the .rss or .xml file on some url, then the client would fetch
the xml file and parse it locally: if the client did not have any of
the fetched feed items locally, It will notify the user that a new
item has been updated and It will update It's local copy.

In other words, the client would compare the newly fetched feed file
and a previous local version (if it had one), then if the fetched file
has more items this means that a new item was published. The way this
notification is presented depends on the client you are using, as well
as the frequency of fetching the updates which you can usually change.

*** RSS Clients

There are a large number of free and open source clients out there,
you may try some and see If you like any of them or just write your
own since It is very simple. For emacs, you could use [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusRss][Gnus]], [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]] or
[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NewsTicker][NewsTicker]] (which comes by default in emacs since emacs 22) or any
other. I tried all three of them and they are great, I like NewsTicker
interface but gnus is more powerful so I use gnus on my daily
workflow.

There are many alternatives outside of emacs, both GUI and tui
such as [[https://tt-rss.org/][tiny tiny RSS]]. A quick search online would help you find
the most suitable one for your likings.

*** How do you use a client

The usage is usually quite straightforward: you add the url of
the feed to your client and you update the feeds when you
want to check for new publications. The client will query all
the urls of the feeds you set up and show you the results.

*** Atom

I really like the simlicity of RSS. An alternative you may find online
are [[https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html][Atom]] feeds which were created to address some of the limitation of
RSS by being more extensible and flexible, but It works exactly the
same for the most part so you can apply what you learned about RSS to
Atom. Usually clients can read both.
