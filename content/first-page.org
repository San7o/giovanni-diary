#+INDEX: Giovanni's Diary!First Page

Dear reader,

first of all, hello and welcome to my [[file:my-public-diary.org][public diary]]. This work is the
result of many months of note taking and journaling, as an ongoing
effort to [[file:documenting.org][document my life]].

The digital diary contains FILES files among pages and images, summing
up to a total of WORDS words. In order to access them, all the pages
are connected through a dense network of references starting from this
page.

The diary is meant to be [[file:secret1.org][explorable]] in any order. For starters, you
can begin digging in a [[file:autobiography/chronological.org][chronological]] order or by [[file:subjects.org][subject]]. If you don't
feel brave enough, you can view a more familiar [[file:blog.org][blog page]] to access my
posts.
