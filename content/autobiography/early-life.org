I was born in the city of Senigallia in the east coast of Italy. Later
my family was joined by a sister and two brothers.

I don't have many memories of my early childhood. When I was about 10
(I think) I began playing minecraft 1.5.2 and watching youtube videos
about the game. The oldest videos I recall are the ones of

and I was slowly learning what blocks were available and how they
worked in the game. I later started a [[https://youtu.be/bq1IvqHm1hM?si=0_RwR9lEFWRqlvIi][survival world]] which I would
continue for many years, my base was in a swamp biome.
