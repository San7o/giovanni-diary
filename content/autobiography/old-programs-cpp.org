* Old cpp programs
#+INDEX: Giovanni's Diary!Autobiography!Old cpp programs

[[https://github.com/San7o/old-cpp-programs][Here]] are the oldest cpp programs of mine I can find. They were
uploaded to google drive on 2018 when I was 14, however I suspect they
were created much earlier.

I first learned about programming after a trip to the mountains with
my family, from the dates of a picture and a video I know we went for
a trip on summer of 2016 and 2017. My guess is that the programs were
created in 2016 since I was already making videogames with Unity
before going to high school.
