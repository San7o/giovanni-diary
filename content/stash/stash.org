This space is for things that do not fit in other categories of the
diary. Those can include literally anything. Series that I rarely
update belong here as well.

When I go to places I usually bring my camera with me to do some
[[file:photography/photography.org][photography]]. Now I hike less frequently, but when I do my camera will
be with me.

I played the [[file:piano.org][piano]] for many years.

I did [[file:volunteering.org][volunteering]] for many years in some local associations, this
was a big part of my life and I learned a lot. Sadly, I quit all
the activities after a big period of burnout.
