** TODO Read "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution" by Steven Levy

I have always been fascinated by the old UNIX people and hacker
culture, I aim to know about them more through this book.

** Interesting books

- Angela's Ashes: memoir by the Irish-American author Frank
  McCourt. Themes of poverty and struggles.
- Whope, from Salvatore Sanfilippo
- The selfish gene: a book about evolution. There is no free will.
