** Find something easy to write

Currently, my writing setup is quite involved. For my Surroundings
series, I need to be outside for at least a couple of hours in a
location I find myself comfortable in. On other posts, I usually take
notes from things I study, like my stoicism page, but this requires me
to research a topic or read a book and write notes. I am looking for
something to write when I have a couple of spare minutes, something
simple just to practice writing. I want something else than ephemeris
when I don't have something interesting to share or an interesting
reflection.
