* Reading

I do like reading, actually *most of my wake time is spent either*
*reading or writing* (on emacs). I would say that most of what I read
is either documentation, code, scientific papers and blog posts.
In fact, I am a huge fan of blogs and they are my main source of
brain-bread.

- Here is a list of my favourite *blogs* to read: file:blogs.org.
  
I also read *books* sometimes, I like history so there is almost
some element of history in anything that I read. Here you will
find some notes related to my readings:

** Writing

I am writing a series called **surroundings** which is about places
and moments: file:surroundings/surroundings.org
  
** Wishlist

I maintain a wishlist of future reading or writings here:
