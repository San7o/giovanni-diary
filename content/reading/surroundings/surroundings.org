* Surroundings

*Surroundings* is a series of descriptions of places I find myself into.
It is a raw translation of what my eyes see looking outward, filtered
by my own mind, in the historical period I live in. The purpose of
those writings is to provide a testimony of what a place looks like
and feels like in a certain moment. It indirectly records what I,
Giovanni, notice and pay attention to and feel, in this particular
moment of my life.
