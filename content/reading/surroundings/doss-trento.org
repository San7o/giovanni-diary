Here I am up Doss Trento, the closest elevation from the city center.
You may recognize this doss by the proud white monument of Cesare
Battisti looking over the valley. The doss feels smaller than expected
from up here, there are two main grass areas: one next to the monument
and another one next to a war museum. I visited the museum a while
ago, displayed were uniforms, weapons and tools used by the people of
this lands during world war 1. The purpose of this entire doss seems
to be to hold the memory of such a terrible past. Some scary weapons
lay on the outside, with some people standing over them as if It were a
bench. Other people come here to walk ther dogs or just to take a
breath.
