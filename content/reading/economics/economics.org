* Economics
#+INDEX: Giovanni's Diary!Reading!Economics

I have been reading some books about economics in order to have a
better understanding of the field.

I started by reading "[[file:henry-hazltt-economics-in-one-lesson.org][Economics in One Lesson]]" by Henry Hazlitt and
following the [[file:finance-theory.org][15.401 Finance Theory]] course at MIT. I also have to
mention [[https://www.youtube.com/@mr_rip][Mr RIP]] whom made me mature a feeling for finance and got me
introduced to the basics.
