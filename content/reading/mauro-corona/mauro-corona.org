* Mauro Corona

Mauro Corona is an italian wood carver who lived much of his life
within **mountains** and rulal mountain villages. Unsurprisingly, he
writes about that aswell.

He has a deep love for mountain life, which fascinates me very
much. His books reflect his raw experience in this world, nothing
more than this but It is everything.

I am reading many of his books, some of my thoughts are accessible
in the following documents:
