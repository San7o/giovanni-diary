#+INDEX: Giovanni's Diary!Reading!Mauro Corona

Mauro Corona is an Italian wood carver who lived much of his life
within **mountains** and rural mountain villages. Unsurprisingly, he
writes about that as well.

He has a deep love for mountain life, which fascinates me very
much. His books reflect his raw experience in this world, nothing
more than this but It is everything.

Some of my thoughts about his books are accessible [[file:notes.org][here]].
