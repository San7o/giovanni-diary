* Giovanni's Diary

Hello fellow traveler, welcome to my humble =public diary=.

Everything is written in =org-mode=, the static html content is
autogenerated for the org files.

To build everything, run =./build.sh=. You will need =emacs= and
=ox-publish= to build the static site.

The website will be online soon.
