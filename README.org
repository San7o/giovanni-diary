* Giovanni's Diary

Hello fellow traveler, welcome to my humble =public diary=.

Web view: https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/

Everything is written in =org-mode= under the =content= directory. The
static html content is autogenerated from the org files. Kudos to
[[https://systemcrafters.net/][SystemCrafters]] for helping configure the website.

I do have quite a huge second-brain in Obsidian, but I wanted to start
from scratch with a public and more curated one using emacs. There
isn't much yet, but It will grow over time.

To build everything, run =giovanni-diary-rebuild-site= after
evaluating =giovanni-diary.el=. This file registers some other helper
functions all prepended with the string =giovanni-diary=.
Note that you need =ox-publish= and, of course, =emacs= to run this.
