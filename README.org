* Giovanni's Diary

Hello fellow traveler, welcome to my humble =public diary=.

Web view: https://giovanni-diary.netlify.app/

Everything is written in =org-mode= in the =content= directory, the
static html content is autogenerated from the org files. Kudos to
https://systemcrafters.net/ for helping configure the website.

I do have quite a huge second-brain in Obsidian, but I wanted to start
from scratch with a public and more curated one using emacs. There
isn't much yet, but It will grow with time.

To build everything, run =./build.sh=. Note that you will need =emacs=
with =ox-publish= to build the static site.
